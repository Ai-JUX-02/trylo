// Stage the vendored OS-sandbox runtime into the build output.
//
// Why this exists: `tsc` only emits from `src/**/*.ts`, so nothing under
// `vendor/**` (JS sources and the srt-win binaries alike) reaches `dist` on
// its own. The Windows isolation adapter resolves both its helper module and
// its executable relative to its own compiled location —
// `dist/internal/adapters/sandbox/vendor/sandbox-runtime/…` — so a build
// without this step ships an adapter whose vendor imports cannot resolve.
// Only the Windows execution entry's static module closure is copied.
//
// Why the binaries are not in `src`: the quality gate (step 8,
// scripts/quality/new-cli.mjs and scripts/quality/verify.mjs) fails any build
// containing a `.exe`/`.dll`/`.bin` or any file over 1 MB, and it scans `src`
// with no exemption mechanism. `scripts/quality/**` is off-limits to this
// package, so the only way to satisfy the gate is to keep the binaries out of
// `src` entirely and lay them down here, after typecheck. They are staged back
// to the same relative path the vendored JS expects, so path resolution in
// windows-isolation.ts and windows-sandbox-utils.js is unchanged.
//
// The SHA-256 of each binary is verified against vendor/sandbox-runtime/
// PROVENANCE.json. A build that stages a tampered or truncated helper fails
// loudly instead of shipping one.
