 * The commit-time gate. Scope: exactly the checks that are cheap enough to
 * run on every commit — the format gate that once stayed red for two days
 * unnoticed (autocrlf made it invisible to `git status`), and the static
 * hygiene scans shared with verify step 3. The heavier gates (tests,
 * architecture prove-fail, license closure) remain `npm run verify`; this
 * hook exists so a red gate cannot ride along with the next commit.
