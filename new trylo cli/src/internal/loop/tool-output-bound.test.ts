 * The loop's own output bound must keep the **tail**, not only the head.
 *
 * The adapters' truncation module exists because "a build log's last line is the
 * error", and `shell-tool.ts` puts the failure advisory and the `[stderr]` block
 * at the *end* of a command's result. A bound that keeps only the head therefore
 * destroys exactly the bytes the model needs to understand a failure — however
 * careful its byte arithmetic is. Correct byte counting is not the same property
 * as keeping the outcome, and only the first one had a test.
