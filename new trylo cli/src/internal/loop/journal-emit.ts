/**
 * Journal emission, extracted from `runner.ts` so the runner does not grow.
 *
 * There is nothing behavioural here: the same two functions, moved to their own
 * file with the host shape they actually need. The runner is a frozen core that
 * has to stay the same length while new seams are added, and this is the piece
 * of it that was pure mechanics — seq numbering and envelope stamping — with no
 * decision in it at all. `Engine` satisfies `EmitHost` structurally, so the call
 * sites did not change.
 *
 * `checksums` is mutated in place because the runner hands the same array out on
 * the turn result; a copy here would silently stop the turn result from matching
 * the journal.
 */
/**
 * An observer of the journal, not a participant in it (WP D1).
 *
 * It is called once per envelope, after that envelope is appended, so what it
 * sees is exactly what the turn recorded and in the order the turn recorded it.
 * It cannot influence the turn: the return value is ignored, a throw is
 * swallowed, and cancellation still travels only through `cancelSignal`. The
 * reason it exists here rather than in a caller is that `emitRaw` is the single
 * append point — hooking anything narrower would miss the envelopes emitted
 * from `host-views.ts` and the observer would stop matching the journal.
