/**
 * What "tools may run in parallel" actually buys (WP22.1 / C05, L03).
 *
 * The reducer already had a batch shape before this package, and a batch whose
 * calls are executed one after another is indistinguishable from no batch at
 * all — it settles correctly and saves nothing. So these tests do not measure
 * elapsed time, which would be a flaky way to say "faster": they ask whether
 * two calls' execution **intervals overlap**, which is either true or false and
 * survives a slow machine.
 *
 * The verdict is read off a log of `start:`/`end:` marks rather than off a
 * clock. One call is given a delay so the overlap has a window to be seen in;
 * without it a fast call could finish before its sibling is even started and
 * the test would say "serial" about code that runs things together.
