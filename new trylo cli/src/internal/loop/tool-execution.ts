 * needs from the in-flight turn arrives as a callback, so the translation below
 * can be read without knowing how the runner stores state.
 *
 * The translation itself is the point. One adapter outcome becomes exactly two
 * records — what the model sees in the transcript and what the journal files —
 * both derived from the same object. A tool therefore cannot report success to
 * the model while the durable record says something else.

 * the two ends and puts the marker in the middle, `codex-rs/utils/string/src/
 * truncate.rs`). An earlier revision read `65_536 + 512`, reasoning that a
 * bounded positioning header from another package needed its own headroom — but
 * that header belongs to the package that adds it, and paying for it here meant a
 * result could reach 66,048B and break the ceiling
 * `adapters/mcp-runtime/approval.test.ts` pins at 65,536 + the marker. Raising
 * this constant is how you change the contract; it is not a per-consumer

 *
 * - **Code points, not code units.** The version before that shrank a prefix by
 *   10% at a time until it fit, which lands between the two halves of a
 *   surrogate pair and leaves a `U+FFFD` spliced into the middle of a token the
 *   model will quote back.
 * - **Both ends, not just the head.** A command's outcome is at the *end*:
 *   `shell-tool.ts` writes the `[stderr]` block and the failure advisory last,
 *   and the adapters' truncation module exists for the same reason ("a build log's
 *   last line is the error"). A head-only bound destroyed precisely those bytes at
 *   the loop, even when the adapter had carefully preserved them — the bound and
 *   the adapter were pulling in opposite directions.
 *
 * The byte primitive itself (`cutToBytes`) is **not** written here: it lives in
 * `protocol/text-cut.ts` so this file and `adapters/**` share one rule instead of
 * two copies that happen to agree. `loop/**` may not import `adapters/**` (the
 * boundary scan rejects `adapters` by name), and `protocol/**` is a layer both
 * sides already import. The even head/tail split below is this file's own policy
 * and stays here; only "cut without breaking a character" is shared.
