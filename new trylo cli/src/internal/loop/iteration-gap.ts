/**
 * The iteration gap (WP D 波 §5.2–§5.4): what a spent budget does to a turn,
 * and what a message typed while the turn was busy does to it.
 *
 * The gap is the one point in a turn where every tool has settled and the next
 * request has not been built — which makes it the only place where "the context
 * is full" can be answered by making the past shorter instead of by giving up,
 * and the only safe place to fold in something a person just said.
 *
 * Three outcomes, and the difference between them is the whole point:
 *
 *  - **`compact_then_continue`** — the ceiling is a *context* ceiling and a
 *    summary can still be authored, so the same logical turn keeps going. This is
 *    the behaviour the survey found in opencode's `TurnTransition` and codex's
 *    mid-turn compact; before this wave a full context ended the turn outright.
 *  - **`await_continuation`** — the turn stopped because it needs a person (an
 *    iteration or token budget ran out), not because it broke. The reducer marks
 *    that on the terminal envelope, so a projection can offer "continue" instead
 *    of reporting a failure the user cannot act on (反方 #22).
 *  - **`terminate`** — everything else.
 *
 * Pure, so the rule is one function with one owner rather than a second copy
 * inside `runner.ts` (which is frozen against growing).

 *  - **A message addressed to another turn is not taken.** Identity is stamped
