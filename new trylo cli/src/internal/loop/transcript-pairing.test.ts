 * L04: a cancelled turn must not leave a `tool_use` unanswered.
 *
 * The legacy runtime had a function for exactly this — `yieldMissingToolResultBlocks`
 * in `trylo cli/src/query.ts:124`, called on the abort path — because a
 * `tool_use` with no `tool_result` makes the next request invalid. Measured
 * missing here: `evidence/2026-10-05-WP07/probe-l04-orphan-tool-use.mjs` recorded
 * a cancelled turn leaving `[user, tool_call, tool_call]` with two orphans.
