/**
 * The narrow views of the engine that its collaborators are allowed to hold.
 *
 * `tool-runner.ts` and the iteration-gap helpers must not see the engine itself
 * — they may emit, dispatch and read the few facts they need, and nothing else.
 * These builders are where that narrowing is written down, and they live here
 * rather than in `runner.ts` so the runner keeps its frozen line budget (the two
 * size gates in `exec-substrate-discipline.test.ts` and
 * `method-line-budget.test.ts`: "split something out", never "widen the
 * ceiling").
 *
 * The only thing they need from the runner is its dispatcher — the function that
 * closes the loop between an effect command and the input that command produces.
 * It is injected rather than imported, because importing it would make this
 * module and `runner.ts` depend on each other at runtime.
