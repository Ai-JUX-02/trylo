/**
 * The workspace checkpoint taken before the first write (WP E 波 §6.2).
 *
 * `ports/checkpoint.ts` and `adapters/checkpoint/**` have been in place for a
 * while without anything calling them, which means undo existed as a capability
 * and not as a fact. This module is the missing call — and it is deliberately
 * the *only* call: one snapshot per turn, taken before the first tool that can
 * change the workspace, because a snapshot per tool call would be a copy of the
 * tree per keystroke and a snapshot after the write would be a picture of the
 * damage.
 *
 * Cline's private git ref transaction is the idea being copied, minus the git:
 * the snapshot is a directory copy outside the workspace, so it can never
 * contain itself and it never rewrites history.
 *
 * Failing to snapshot is **reported, not fatal**. Refusing to run a write the
 * user approved because undo storage is unavailable would be a second, worse
 * decision made in the dark; the observation carries the code so the run is
 * visibly unprotected instead of silently unprotected.
