/**
 * The net unified diff for one turn, from committed file mutations.
 *
 * Shape-port of Codex `core/src/turn_diff_tracker.rs` (`TurnDiffTracker`):
 * baseline/current maps per path, an origin map for renames, rename pairing,
 * and whole-turn invalidation when a delta is not exact. What is deliberately
 * not ported is the re-render: Codex keeps full before/after contents and
 * renders with `similar`; here the committed preview strings *are* what
 * landed (see `apply-patch-preview.ts`: rendering from ops, never re-diffing),
 * so the net diff aggregates previews instead of re-rendering contents.
 *
 * Two honest deltas from Codex, both recorded rather than hidden:
 *
 * - First-touch before-content is not retained, so a file the turn creates
 *   and a file it rewrites can render alike as additions. Rename pairing
 *   still applies the structural guards (see `pairOrigin`), but content
 *   equality beyond the previews is out of reach.
 * - Display bounding (the 64k cap here, the 120-line cap in previews) is
 *   *not* inexactness: Codex invalidates on incomplete *deltas*, not on
 *   shortened *renderings*. A truncated rendering carries its marker.
 *
 * One turn, one tracker: the loop creates it in `assembleEngine`, feeds
 * every committed mutating-tool outcome through `noteTurnDiff`, and
 * publishes the net diff on the turn result. It never touches the workspace
 * — rereading the tree would race the next write — and it never touches the
 * journal. Like Codex, it is a live-turn artifact: a restarted session keeps
 * the durable `file_write` facts but not the previews, so a net diff cannot
 * be rebuilt after the fact without a journal shape change (see the WP11
 * construction record for the deferred migration).
