/**
 * Durable intent for mutating tools (WP05 WP05.3, OPEN-WP05-2).
 *
 * The port contract (`ports/execution-progress.ts`) already requires that
 * `issue` acknowledge durability before a tool begins; this test proves the
 * loop honours it. A turn killed after the issue but before the settle must
 * leave the intent in the journal — that is what makes post-crash
 * reconciliation (WP01.3) possible instead of a guess about what ran.
 *
 * The verdict is read off one shared timeline: the progress port and the
 * tools write into the same log, so "before" means before. For every call,
 * `flush` < `issue` < `start`, and the whole issue phase precedes the whole
 * execution phase — a kill in between leaves intents without effects, which
 * is exactly the state `reconcileRequired` describes.
