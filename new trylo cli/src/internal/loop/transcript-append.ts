 * # Why this must exist
 *
 * A cancelled turn can leave the transcript holding `tool_use` blocks that no
 * `tool_result` ever answers. The legacy runtime had a dedicated function for
 * exactly this — `yieldMissingToolResultBlocks` in `trylo cli/src/query.ts:124`,
 * called on the abort path — because a `tool_use` without a matching
 * `tool_result` is an invalid request for most providers, and the next turn
 * after an interrupt would be rejected outright.
 *
 * It was missing here. Measured in
 * `evidence/2026-10-05-WP07/probe-l04-orphan-tool-use.mjs`: cancelling a turn
 * whose stream had already emitted two `tool_call` blocks produced a transcript
 * of `[user, tool_call, tool_call]` — two orphans, zero results.
 *
 * # What it does *not* claim
 *
 * The synthetic result says the call was cancelled. It does not say the tool
 * succeeded, and it does not invent output: `outcome: "cancelled"` with empty
 * output is the honest shape, and a caller reading it back can tell the
 * difference between "this produced nothing" and "this was stopped".
