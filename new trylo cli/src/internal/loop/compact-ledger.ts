 * *the decision to compact and what the model then sees*. The dependency runs
 * one way — the decision module imports the ledger module, never the reverse —
 * so there is no cycle to reason about.
 *
 * Two invariants live here and are the reason this is not folded back:
 *
 *  - the ledger is the only place a stored window is remembered, and it is
 *    never persisted; the journal is derived from it on every call;
 *  - the derivation is a pure function of (session id, transcript, entries), so
 *    two readers of the same turn cannot disagree about which records exist.
