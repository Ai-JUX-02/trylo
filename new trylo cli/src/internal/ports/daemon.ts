/**
 * The scheduler daemon's lifecycle contract (WP26 / A04 + the A06 host).
 *
 * ## Why a daemon and not a `setInterval` in the foreground process
 *
 * ADR §5: "CLI 关闭后继续调度的具体宿主是受管 daemon，不是前台进程内一个
 * setInterval." The reason is not tidiness. A `setInterval` dies with the
 * terminal that ran it, so `trylo run` would end the schedule it was created to
 * keep — and the person would find out by a job that silently stopped. The
 * daemon is the thing that has to outlive the session for a *background*
 * schedule to mean anything.
 *
 * ## The states, and the two refusals that matter
 *
 * ```text
 * stopped ──start──> running ──stop──> stopped
 *    ▲                │
 *    │                ├──crash──> crashed ──restart──> running
 *    └────unhealthy───┘
 * ```
 *
 * `running` is the only state that claims work is being done. `crashed` is
 * **not** `stopped`: a daemon that died with work in flight has an unsettled
 * occurrence, and restarting it is a different operation from starting it fresh.
 * That distinction is the reason this is a union rather than a boolean — a
 * supervisor that answers "is it up?" with `crashed → false` would happily start
 * a second daemon over the first one's lease.
 *
 * `unhealthy` is a third refusal, and it is here because the win32 identity check
 * can come back `unverifiable`. A daemon whose identity cannot be confirmed must
 * not be reported as running, and must not be reported as gone either — the third
 * answer is what stops a supervisor from spawning replacements at a daemon it
 * merely failed to ask about.
