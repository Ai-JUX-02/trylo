/**
 * Web search, as a port the loop can be lent (WP20.1: C58 / L21).
 *
 * Why a port and not a tool that owns its own HTTP: a search is only real if
 * some named backend actually performed it, and *which* backend is a fact about
 * the run's provider, not about the tool table. The tool therefore receives a
 * `WebSearchPort` or is not mounted at all — see `adapters/tools/web/search`.
 * A `web_search` binding with no backend behind it would advertise a capability
 * the run cannot honour, which this package treats as worse than absence: the
 * model would keep asking for something every layer has already refused.
 *
 * The failure vocabulary is closed because "search did not work" has exactly
 * three honest answers — the backend cannot search (`unavailable`), the backend
 * tried and the provider said no (`auth`, `rate_limit`, `network`), or the
 * search genuinely had nothing (`empty_result`). A backend that cannot tell
 * them apart has to invent one, and an invented answer here is a fabricated
 * search result wearing a citation.
