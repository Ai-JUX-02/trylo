/**
 * Scheduled work — the port a fireable schedule lives behind (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * ## The three identifiers, and why there are three
 *
 * A schedule says *when*. An occurrence is *one due moment of that schedule*.
 * An attempt is *one try at running that occurrence*. Collapsing them is how a
 * scheduler ends up unable to answer "did this run, and did it run twice":
 *
 * - schedule id + fire time identifies the occurrence, and is **derived, not
 *   random** — the same schedule and the same due moment always produce the
 *   same occurrence id. That is what makes a restart re-derive the work it
 *   already owes instead of inventing a second copy of it.
 * - attempt id is random per try, because two tries at the same occurrence are
 *   genuinely different events and must be told apart in the record.
 *
 * Everything downstream (journal, queue, worker) keys off these, so a
 * duplicate delivery, a retry after a crash, and a resumed session all name the
 * same occurrence rather than three lookalikes.
 *
 * ## What this port deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not run anything, and it does not know how a task is executed. It
 * answers three questions — what is scheduled, which occurrences are due, and
 * acknowledge that one was handled — and the host decides who runs them. A port
 * that both decided and ran would put scheduling policy inside an executor,
 * which is where the single-owner rule stops being checkable.
 *
 * ## The recovery contract, in states rather than promises
 *
 * Occurrences carry an explicit lifecycle, because "it fired" and "it
 * finished" are different facts and conflating them is how work gets lost:
 *
 * ```text
 * due ──claim──> claimed ──hand off──> dispatched ──settle──> completed
 *                  │                      │
 *                  └──cancel──> cancelled │──fail──> failed
 *                                        └──effect uncertain──> unknown
 * ```
 *
 * `unknown` is a first-class terminal, not a flavour of `failed`. It means the
 * effect may or may not have landed; it is the state a crash between "ran" and
 * "recorded the receipt" leaves behind. Answering `failed` there would invite a
 * retry of work that may already have been done, and answering `completed`
 * would be a lie about something nobody observed. A caller in `unknown` hands
 * the occurrence to reconciliation and does not retry by itself.
