/**
 * Memory retrieval, as a port (WP20.3: C60 / L51).
 *
 * What "memory" means here is deliberately narrow, because the word is doing
 * too much work in most designs. This port reads **records Trylo already
 * persisted** — the learning board's activated assets and the project rule
 * files a run adopted — and hands back matching lines. It does not decide what
 * is worth remembering, does not write, and does not promote anything into an
 * asset. Learning sedimentation and asset governance stay exactly where they
 * are: in the learning control plane, behind its own writer.
 *
 * That boundary is why this is a read port over an injected document source
 * rather than a second store. Codex's `memories` extension keeps its own
 * directory and its own `add_ad_hoc_note` writer; copying that shape here would
 * put a second writer next to the board and give the run two answers to "what
 * did I learn". Only the retrieval leaves are reused: the match modes, the
 * context window, the cursor pagination and the explicit truncation flag.
 *
 * Every failure is a value. A memory read that cannot be satisfied says which
 * of the three things went wrong — the document is gone, the cursor is not one
 * of ours, or the query is empty — because a search that silently returned
 * nothing would be indistinguishable from "this run has no memory", and a model
 * cannot tell those apart.
