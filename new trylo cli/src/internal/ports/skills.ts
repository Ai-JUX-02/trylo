 * Skills (WP14): installed SKILL.md documents the run can actually consume.

 * The catalog port is the seam between discovery (an adapter that reads skill
 * directories) and the loop's tool table (the `skill` tool). Like
 * `ports/memory.ts`, the port is lent to the tools, never constructed by them:
 * where skills live is the composition root's decision, and WP16's plugin
 * sources will satisfy this same port rather than grow a second one.
 *
 * Lifetime: a catalog is frozen per turn, like the project instructions. The
 * composition root rebuilds it at each turn boundary, which is what makes an
 * uninstalled skill stop being injected without any cache to clear.
