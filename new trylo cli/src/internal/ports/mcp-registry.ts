/**
 * MCP server registry port.
 *
 * A registry entry is *configuration*, not an installation. It records the
 * command a user asked Trylo to be able to run later; it never downloads
 * anything, never runs `npm install`, and never edits `PATH`. That separation
 * is what keeps `add` a pure shape check: a command whose binary does not exist
 * is still a legal entry, and the failure shows up at connect time where it can
 * be reported honestly.
 *
 * Two scopes exist, and they are *not* merged into one flat table:
 *
 *  - `user`    — one file shared by every project on the machine;
 *  - `project` — one file per workspace, meant to be version controlled.
 *
 * `list` merges them for display, and project wins on the fields a project is
 * allowed to override (see {@link McpEffectiveEntry}). The merge is a fact
 * about the *view*, not about the stored files: removing a registry entry is
 * always an explicit operation on one scope, and a project file can never
 * delete a user entry by omission.
 *
 * The registry is deliberately not an event log. There is no sequence number
 * and no append: a broken file is a broken file, and the reader fails closed
 * rather than interpreting a truncated document as "the user has no servers".

 * An entry whose transport is in this list is *representable*; whether the
 * remote endpoint answers is a connect-time fact, exactly like a stdio binary
 * that does not exist yet.
