/**
 * Credential ledger port — the *secret* half of configuration.
 *
 * The counterpart of `ports/settings.ts`. Settings loads non-secret
 * configuration and refuses secrets outright; this port stores them. The two are
 * deliberately separate (opencode's "declarations and credentials split",
 * D6 §10.7): a settings file must never be able to declare a credential, and a
 * credential ledger is not a configuration layer.
 *
 * Scope, stated so the boundary is unmissable:
 *
 *  - **This is a ledger, not an authority.** Reading an API key here is not a
 *    tool grant. Nothing in this package feeds the PermissionGate; a credential
 *    is data, not permission and not evidence. `CredentialPort` has no verb that
 *    approves, grants or admits anything.
 *  - **Two scopes, not one flat table.** `user` is one file shared by every
 *    project; `project` is one file per workspace. Each *provider* carries its
 *    own current pointer, so switching the OpenAI account does not move the
 *    fixture one.
 *  - **Environment wins, but is never written.** A declared environment variable
 *    overrides every file layer and is read-only: `login`/`set` never persist it
 *    and never mutate `process.env`.
 *  - **Secrets appear in exactly two ok branches** — `get` and `exportSecrets` —
 *    and nowhere else. `status`, `list`, `exportPublic` and every failure
 *    `detail` are secret-free by construction (`credentials/redact.ts` is the
 *    single scrubbing point).
 *  - **OS keyring and OAuth are out of scope.** A `keyring` backend kind exists
 *    so the port can *be* backed by one later, but production assembly does not
 *    attach a real keyring, and reaching an unimplemented keyring backend fails
 *    closed as `keyring_unavailable` rather than pretending the file holds it.
 *
 * The dependency on `credentials/ids.js` and `credentials/env-table.js` is a
 * type/constant-only import of pure enumerations (no I/O), which keeps the
 * contract acyclic: the domain modules implement against these types and never
 * import this port back into a cycle.
