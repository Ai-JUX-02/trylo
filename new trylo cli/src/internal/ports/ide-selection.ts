/**
 * What a person has selected in their editor, in Trylo's words.
 *
 * Reused from the legacy CLI's IDE integration, which speaks MCP: the editor
 * exposes a server named `ide` and pushes a `selection_changed` notification.
 * That transport is **not** reproduced here — it belongs to the MCP runtime, and
 * duplicating a WebSocket client beside it would create a second way to reach an
 * editor, which is the exact "照名字再造第二套服务" the package contract forbids.
 * What is reproduced is the part that is genuinely ours: what a selection *is*,
 * and what it is allowed to become.
 *
 * The design problem this file solves is small and real. A selection arrives as
 * `{start:{line,character}, end:{line,character}, text, filePath}` and has to
 * become text a turn can carry. Three things have to be decided, and each has one
 * right answer:
 *
 *   - an **empty** selection is not a selection; it is the cursor, and attaching
 *     "the line you are on" unasked is noise;
 *   - an end position of `character: 0` on a later line means the selection ends
 *     at the *start* of that line, so counting it would report one line too many;
 *   - a selection whose file is unknown, or whose text is absent, cannot be
 *     expanded by us — the caller must be told, because silently attaching
 *     nothing produces a turn that looks complete and is missing its context.
