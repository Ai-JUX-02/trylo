/**
 * Background sessions as a person addresses them (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it is deliberately not
 *
 * Old CLI's `claude ps | logs | attach | kill` was a second, independent notion of
 * "a running command" — its own registry under `~/.claude/sessions/`, with the
 * directory missing on this checkout. This package already has the real thing
 * (`adapters/process-session/**`, from WP06/WP07): one registry, bounded output
 * buffers, a process-tree kill, and a PTY path.
 *
 * So this file is an **addressing layer**, not a second registry. It translates
 * between four verbs a person uses and the one registry that holds the facts. A
 * second registry would be the exact failure ADR §5 names: "同一主机少量共享执行
 * owner，不按十项另建十套后台总管".
 *
 * ## The four verbs, and what each one is honest about
 *
 * - `ps` lists what is running. It reads the registry; it never polls the process
 *   table, because the registry is already the authority and a second probe could
 *   disagree with it.
 * - `logs` reads the buffer. **`droppedOutput` travels with the answer** — a
 *   truncated log that looks complete is how a person concludes a program printed
 *   nothing when it printed a megabyte.
 * - `attach` *watches*, it does not take over. There is no second reader of a
 *   running session's input; `attach` is a bounded read with a cursor, which is
 *   what `tail -f` is, and what an interactive takeover would have to be to be
 *   safe with a session another agent may also be watching.
 * - `kill` goes through the registry's `stop`, so the process **tree** goes and
 *   Windows' `cmd.exe`-leaves-grandchildren problem stays solved in one place.
