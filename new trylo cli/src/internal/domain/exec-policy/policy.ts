/**
 * Turning a set of prefix rules into one answer about one command.
 *
 * Source of the semantics: Codex `execpolicy/src/policy.rs` at commit
 * `73a1148c9c775c2a4616ce5096291740a00ed68a`. Two decisions are worth writing
 * down because they are the ones a reader would otherwise "simplify" into bugs:
 *
 *  1. Rules are keyed by the *first token*, so matching is a lookup, not a
 *     scan. A first token of alternatives becomes several rules when the policy
 *     is built (see `parse.ts`); the map key is always one word.
 *  2. Several rules can match at once, and the **most severe** wins
 *     (`strictestOf`). Individually harmless rules must not add up to
 *     permission.
