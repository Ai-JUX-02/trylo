/**
 * Turning an operator's policy document into a policy.
 *
 * Source of the semantics: Codex `execpolicy/src/parser.rs` at commit
 * `73a1148c9c775c2a4616ce5096291740a00ed68a`. Upstream writes these rules in
 * Starlark; this leaves that dialect out and keeps everything else — the three
 * shape checks, the *examples must actually match* self-verification, and the
 * expansion of an alternative first token into one rule per alternative.
 *
 * Examples are given as argument arrays rather than command strings. A second
 * command-line splitter would be a second opinion about quoting, and the two
 * would eventually disagree about something that matters; the one that already
 * exists (`adapters/sandbox/command.ts`) belongs to the shell boundary, not
 * here.
 *
 * `host_executable` names must be bare names with no extension, which is one
 * step stricter than upstream's "one path component": accepting `python.exe`
 * there would leave two different spellings of the same program fighting over
 * one lookup key, and the operator's own rules would then silently stop
 * covering the spelling they wrote.
