/**
 * The three answers an execution policy can give about one command.
 *
 * Source of the semantics: Codex `execpolicy/src/decision.rs` at commit
 * `73a1148c9c775c2a4616ce5096291740a00ed68a`. The set is copied, not
 * reinvented, because each member already carries a distinct terminal meaning:
 *
 *  - `allow`    the policy itself authorises the command; no human is asked;
 *  - `prompt`   the policy has no opinion worth trusting, so a human decides;
 *  - `forbidden` the policy refuses; asking would imply it might be allowed.
 *
 * `allow` is therefore *not* an absent answer and `forbidden` is *not* a
 * stricter `prompt`: the three are what let this layer say something before a
 * person is involved at all.
