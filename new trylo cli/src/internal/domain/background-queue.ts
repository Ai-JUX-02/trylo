/**
 * What to do with a session's queue when the session goes idle.
 *
 * Codex's `dispatch_if_idle` decides this against a running thread, and its one
 * rule is that a message is removed only *after* the core has started a turn
 * from it. That order is the whole point, and it is what makes "at most once"
 * true across a crash: a message removed before the turn starts is a message
 * that can be lost, and a message removed after a start that never happened is a
 * message delivered to nothing.
 *
 * So this module produces the decision and nothing else. Deciding is pure;
 * starting a turn is not, and the caller owns that. What comes back is which
 * message to start from, or why no message may be started — never "start it and
 * then see".

/**
 * Whether a queue is one whose first message may start a turn.
 *
 * Takes the port's own `QueuePage` rather than a loose shape, so the decision is
 * made from exactly what the adapter read — including `total`, which this
 * function deliberately ignores. The first message is the one that goes first
 * whether or not nine more are behind it; that is the ordering the person saw
 * when they queued them.
 *
 * Empty is `idle`, and unreadable is `unknown` — the two are kept apart on
 * purpose. A caller that maps both to "nothing to do" reports a queue it could
 * not read as an empty one, and the person concludes their message was never
 * queued. Codex keeps them apart too: `dispatch_if_idle` returns on
 * `NotSubmitted` and on error without deleting anything, so a message survives
 * a dispatch that could not happen.
 *
 * A message with blank text is also `unknown`-shaped rather than startable: it
 * reached durable storage by some path this process did not validate, and
 * starting a turn from nothing would spend a provider request to say nothing.
 * It is *not* removed here — dropping another writer's message on the grounds
 * that it looks wrong is not this module's call.
