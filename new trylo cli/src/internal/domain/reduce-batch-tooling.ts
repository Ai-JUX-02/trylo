/**
 * Batch members whose outcome is a *refusal* or a permission decision, rather
 * than a tool result.
 *
 * The reducer has two shapes of tool execution (see `reduce-tooling.ts`) and
 * they answer a refusal differently on purpose:
 *
 *  - **single** — the run's only call was refused, so the turn is over. That is
 *    the historical behaviour and it stays byte for byte.
 *  - **batch** — one refused member is a fact about *that* member. The model is
 *    owed a visible result for it, the other members still run, and the phase
 *    only returns to `turning` when the last of them has landed. A batch that
 *    ended the turn on its first refusal would leave the remaining call IDs
 *    unsettled and the next provider request holding `tool_call`s with no
 *    `tool_result`s — the very shape `illegal_transition` / `unsettled_tool_input`
 *    used to produce on a plain four-file read.
 *
 * The one refusal that still fails closed is `permission_failed`: a permission
 * port that cannot answer is a broken gate, not a decision, and a turn that
 * cannot be gated must not keep executing tools.
 */

/**
 * Registration of a member that needs a person first.
 *
 * It joins the batch and asks; it does not leave `tooling`. The single-call
 * shape parks in `approval_waiting` with one `activeToolCallId`, which cannot
 * express "this one is waiting while its siblings are still unregistered" — a
 * second member's `tool_request` arriving during that park would be an illegal
 * transition. `request_permission` is emitted as a command, so the loop still
 * gets to register every member of the response before it interprets any of
 * them.
