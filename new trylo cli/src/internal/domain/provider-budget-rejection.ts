/**
 * Classifying a provider's own budget rejections (WP09.3 / L06).
 *
 * The port carries a provider refusal as an `error` event with a class and a
 * message. Inside that pair, a few message shapes name a *budget* refusal —
 * the prompt or an attachment, not the model's conduct — and each named shape
 * has exactly one honest answer:
 *
 *  - `prompt_too_long` — the request itself is over the provider's context
 *    window; a compaction is the answer, so the loop may force one and retry;
 *  - `media_too_large` — an attachment is over the provider's size limit;
 *    there is no honest recovery (dropping the attachment would drop the
 *    user's words), so the loop reports the classification and fails.
 *
 * Everything else is not a budget refusal and stays whatever the failure path
 * already makes of it. The patterns are inherited from the legacy runtime's
 * recovery branches (`trylo cli/src/query.ts` prompt-too-long handling) and
 * Codex's context-window errors; they match messages, because the wire has no
 * better code for this — the class alone (`invalid_request`) also covers
 * ordinary bad requests that no compaction can fix.
