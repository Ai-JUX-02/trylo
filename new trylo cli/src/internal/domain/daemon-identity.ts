/**
 * Daemon process identity (WP26 / A04, and the discovery half of A05).
 *
 * ## Why a pid is not an identity
 *
 * Windows recycles process ids. A daemon that recorded only its pid can, after a
 * reboot or a busy afternoon, find that its pid now belongs to somebody else's
 * process — and then either fail to notice it died or, worse, report itself
 * healthy while talking to a stranger. `kill(pid, 0)` cannot tell the two apart.
 *
 * Codex solves this with the same pair this module uses: `pid` **and**
 * `process_start_time` (`codex-rs/app-server-daemon/src/backend/pid.rs:43`, and
 * the comparisons at `:168` and `:555`). The rule is one line: the identity holds
 * only while both halves match.
 *
 * ## How the start time is obtained, and what that costs
 *
 * Measured on this machine (win32, Node v22.22.2 — see
 * `evidence/2026-10-07-WP26-review/process-identity.out.txt`):
 *
 *  - Node's standard library exposes **no** process start time. `process.report`
 *    has no such header, and `process.uptime()` is self-relative so it cannot be
 *    compared against another reading.
 *  - `Win32_Process.CreationDate` via PowerShell **works**, returning an ISO
 *    timestamp to sub-second precision.
 *  - `wmic process get CreationDate` does **not** work on this host (absent or
 *    blocked), so it is not an alternative.
 *  - That query costs roughly 200–600 ms per call.
 *
 * The cost is why the start time is **written at spawn time by the parent**, which
 * knows it from `Date.now()`, and only *verified* on demand. A daemon never polls
 * its own record; a discovery query verifies one candidate. That keeps a
 * 200–600 ms system call off every tick.
 *
 * ## What verification degrades to
 *
 * {@link DaemonIdentityProbe} is a seam, and the default implementation accepts an
 * injected verifier. A caller that cannot verify (no PowerShell on a stripped
 * image) gets `unverifiable` — which is **not** the same answer as `matching`.
 * Reporting "alive" from the pid alone would defeat the entire reason this file
 * exists, so the unverifiable case is surfaced and the caller decides.
