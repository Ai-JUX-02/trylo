/**
 * Cron expression parsing and next-run computation (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * Mechanical reuse of old CLI `src/utils/cron.ts` (sha256 prefix
 * `e8ba70b31453d6e7`, 308 lines), with one algorithm change that the WP26
 * review proved was load-bearing: the fall-back hour anchor.
 *
 * The 5-field subset is unchanged — `minute hour day-of-month month
 * day-of-week`, with wildcard / `N` / `*\/N` / `N-M[\/N]` / comma lists. No
 * `L`, `W`, `?`, or name aliases. Times are **local**, because a person
 * writing "0 9 * * *" means 9am where they are sitting.
 *
 * ## Why the old `computeNextCronRun` was wrong, and what replaced it
 *
 * The old algorithm rounded `from` up to the next whole minute and then walked
 * forward using `setMinutes` / `setHours` / `setDate`. On a spring-forward day
 * those setters *skip* the missing hour; on a fall-back day the wall clock
 * reads 01:00–01:59 **twice**, and stepping forward from the first 01:xx
 * lands the candidate on the *second* 01:xx — which is one hour **earlier**
 * in real time than where it started.
 *
 * Measured, America/New_York, `* * * * *`, `from = 2026-11-01T01:10:00-05:00`
 * (the second 01:10, EDT):
 *
 * ```text
 * old next = 2026-11-01T05:11:00Z   (= 01:11 EDT — an *earlier* instant)
 * from     = 2026-11-01T06:10:00Z
 * ```
 *
 * A scheduler that trusts that will fire a task before it was due, and — worse
 * — on the next tick compute an earlier "next" again, which is how a
 * recurring task turns into a tight loop. So `next > from` is the invariant
 * this module exists to hold, and `schedule-cron.test.ts` pins it.
 *
 * The fix keeps local-time semantics rather than escaping to UTC: the walk is
 * unchanged, but the candidate is only accepted once its real-time value is
 * strictly after `from`, and each forward step is measured as a **duration**
 * so the repeated hour cannot fold backwards. Both DST cases the old code got
 * right stay right — see `spring gap` and `fall-back fires once` in the tests.
 *
 * This module is pure: no clock, no filesystem, no randomness. The wall clock
 * arrives as `from`, which is what makes every case here testable.

 *
 * ## How the fall-back bug is avoided
 *
 * Two rules, and the second is the one the old code lacked:
 *
 * 1. Every field test is a *local* read (`getHours`, `getDate`, …), so the
 *    expression keeps meaning "9am where the user is".
 * 2. After a candidate is found, it is accepted only if `candidate.getTime() >
 *    from.getTime()`. A wall-clock walk over a repeated hour produces
 *    candidates whose *real* time can be earlier than the starting point; this
 *    check refuses those and lets the walk continue. Without it the walk can
 *    also stall (a candidate that is always rejected), so each step advances
 *    the clock by a whole minute of **real** time, which guarantees
 *    termination even while the local reading is frozen.
 *
 * Standard cron day semantics are kept: when both day-of-month and
 * day-of-week are constrained, a match on **either** counts. `0 9 13 * 5`
 * fires on the 13th *and* on every Friday.
 *
 * DST behaviour, both pinned by tests:
 *  - **Spring forward**: a fixed-hour expression targeting the missing hour
 *    skips that day — the gap hour never appears in local time. `30 2 * * *`
 *    on a US spring-forward day fires the next day.
 *  - **Fall back**: the repeated hour fires **once**. From an anchor inside the
 *    first 01:xx the next fire is in the second 01:xx (a later real instant);
 *    from an anchor inside the second 01:xx the next fire is an hour later.
 *    That is what `next > from` buys, and it is why this module never advances
 *    by a wall-clock field jump once a match is found.

/**
 * Find the first matching time of day on the local calendar day of `day`, as a

 *
 * ## Why the candidate is built from calendar parts, not from `day`
 *
 * `day` is midnight of the target day, so `new Date(day).setHours(h, m, 0, 0)`
 * looks like it should land on that same day. It does not always: near a
 * transition the offset in force at midnight differs from the one in force at
 * `h:m`, and applying the day's own offset to a wall-clock time in the other
 * half shifts the instant onto the neighbouring day. Observed as a
 * `30 * * * *` job anchored inside the repeated hour reporting "tomorrow
 * 00:30" while 02:30 the same day was still ahead of it.
 *
 * `new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes)` re-derives the offset for the
 * target wall-clock time instead of reusing midnight's, which is what a person
 * means by "02:30 on the 1st".
 *
 * Inside one calendar day the hours and minutes are ascending in both arrays
 * (`expandField` sorts them), so the first candidate that is after `fromMs` is
 * the earliest one — the `>` re-check is what makes that true on the repeated
 * hour, where a candidate can otherwise land on the *second* reading of a
 * wall-clock time and be earlier as an instant.
 *
 * `null` when the day has no matching time after `fromMs`. That happens on the
 * repeated hour, and then the next day is the honest answer.
