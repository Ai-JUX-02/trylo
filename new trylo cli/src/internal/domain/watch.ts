/**
 * Sleeping until something happens, and noticing when it does (WP26 / A07).
 *
 * ## What this is, and why it is not a second scheduler
 *
 * "Wake me when the build finishes" and "remind me at 3am" are the same shape of
 * problem: something is true at an unknown future moment, and a side effect should
 * happen once. The reused `A06` schedule port already owns the "when" and the
 * single-writer lease; the queue already owns delivery. So this module is only
 * the part neither of them has: **deciding whether a condition is met right now,
 * and making sure a condition that stays met does not fire forever.**
 *
 * ## The three states a watch can be in
 *
 * ```text
 * idle ──condition met──> fired (terminal)
 *   │                      ▲
 *   └──cancelled──> cancelled (terminal)
 * ```
 *
 * `armed` is the only live state, and a watch is created armed. There is
 * deliberately no "armed but firing" state, because the whole failure this
 * guards against is firing twice while the condition is still true — a build that
 * takes four minutes and a file watcher that fires on every save would otherwise
 * both produce a burst.
 *
 * ## The deduplication rule, stated as a fact rather than a hope
 *
 * A watch fires **once per occurrence**, and the occurrence id is
 * `watch_<id>@<fireAtMs>` (via `watchOccurrenceId`) — the same derived shape
 * the schedule port uses. That is
 * what makes "did this already fire?" answerable from the record on disk rather
 * than from a boolean in memory that a restart would forget.
