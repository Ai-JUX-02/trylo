/**
 * Describing a cron expression in words (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * Split out of `schedule-cron.ts` under the file-size gate, and split on
 * purpose rather than for tidiness: parsing and next-run computation are
 * **arithmetic**, this is **presentation**. They have different readers — one
 * is a scheduler that must be right, the other is a person deciding whether
 * the job they just created is the one they meant — and a change to the
 * wording must never be able to alter when a task fires.
 *
 * Mechanical reuse of old CLI `src/utils/cron.ts` (the `cronToHuman` half).
 * Coverage is deliberately narrow: a scheduler that mis-describes a job is
 * worse than one that shows the expression, because the person reads the
 * description and stops looking at the expression.
