/**
 * Watching for a condition and firing once (WP26 / A07, the retained part).
 *
 * The cases here are the ones where a condition watcher misbehaves in a way that
 * is invisible until it has already cost something:
 *
 *  - a condition that stays true firing on every tick (the burst);
 *  - a restart re-deriving a watch and firing the same one twice;
 *  - a cancel that reports success on something that already ran.
 *
 * The file conditions use **real files**, because "does this file exist" is the
 * one place where a mock would hide a path bug that only shows up in production.
