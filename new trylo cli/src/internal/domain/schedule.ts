/**
 * Scheduling decisions, with no clock, no filesystem and no IO (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * Everything here answers a question a host must be able to answer *before* it
 * does anything irreversible: is this schedule valid, which occurrences are due
 * at this instant, is this lease still ours, and what does a delete actually
 * stop. Those questions are pure, so they are decided here and tested without
 * waiting for a minute to pass.
 *
 * Mechanical reuse of old CLI `utils/cronTasks.ts` (sha256 prefix
 * `af141a07fe8`) for the anchor rule, and `utils/cronScheduler.ts` for the
 * age-out. Two things are deliberately *not* reused, because they are the
 * defects this package exists to remove:
 *
 *  - The old scheduler treated a task's next fire as recomputable from
 *    `createdAt`, so a recurring task's fire time was lost on restart and it
 *    either replayed a week of fires at once or re-armed from the wrong point.
 *    Here `lastFiredAtMs` is the anchor, so a restart resumes.
 *  - The old scheduler stamped `lastFiredAt` and then fired, so a crash between
 *    the two lost the fire entirely. Here an occurrence is *derived* from
 *    `(scheduleId, dueAtMs)` and its state is recorded, so a crash leaves a
 *    nameable state rather than a hole.

/**
 * The next due moment of one schedule, or `null` when it has none left.
 *
 * ## The anchor is `lastFiredAtMs`, not `createdAtMs`
 *
 * This is the restart rule, and it is the reason the field exists. A recurring
 * schedule that fired yesterday must next fire relative to *yesterday*, not
 * relative to its creation a week ago — anchoring on creation makes the walk
 * start in the past and either fire immediately or replay every missed slot.
 *
 * A **one-shot** is different: its fire time is pinned by the person ("remind
 * me at 3pm on the 28th"), so it anchors on `createdAtMs` and keeps that
 * anchor even after firing — a one-shot that is re-read after it fired must not
 * silently acquire a second due time.
 *
 * ## This answers "when next", never "is it due"
 *
 * The second parameter is the *anchor for the walk* when the schedule has never
 * fired — the moment the schedule was created, or the moment recovery is asking
 * about. It is not a comparison against the host clock, and conflating the two
 * is a bug this function's shape prevents: whether an occurrence is due is
 * `dueAtMs <= nowMs`, and that comparison belongs to the caller, which is the
 * only place that knows what "now" means for this host.
 *
 * The missed-fire case is handled by the anchor, not by a special branch. A
 * scheduler that was down for a week still reports the *first* slot after its
 * last fire; `dueOccurrences` compares that against now and finds it in the past,
 * which is how a long gap produces one owed occurrence rather than a week of
 * them.
