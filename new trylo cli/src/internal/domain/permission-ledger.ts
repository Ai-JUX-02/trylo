/**
 * The permission ledger's own three states (WP03.3 / F02).
 *
 * The loop already distinguishes "ran and reported", "ran and failed" and "we
 * never found out" for tool calls (`loop/tool-execution.ts`, and the `unknown`
 * there is load-bearing: an adapter that threw is not the same claim as a tool
 * that ran). A permission decision needs the same three, for the same reason and
 * with one extra edge: the interesting case is not the failure, it is the
 * *approval that may or may not have been spent*.
 *
 * A grant is spent before the work it authorises happens, because the work may
 * be a process that outlives this CLI. So the honest sequence for one authorised
 * call is:
 *
 *   issued    the decision was made and the grant (if any) is committed to store
 *   committed the work finished and the effect is a fact
 *   unknown   we issued, and then the world stopped answering
 *
 * `unknown` is not a failure code and must never be recorded as one. Recording it
 * as `failed` would tell a later reader that nothing happened, which is the one
 * claim nobody is entitled to make after a crash mid-flight: the process may well
 * be running. Recording it as `committed` is the opposite error, and the
 * expensive one — it manufactures permission. This is the same fail-closed
 * direction as the rest of the permission chain, applied to the record rather
 * than to the decision.
 *
 * What is deliberately not here: any storage. This module decides what may be
 * claimed and in what order; where the claims go belongs to whoever owns the
 * journal.
