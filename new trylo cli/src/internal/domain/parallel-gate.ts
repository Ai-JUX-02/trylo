/**
 * The admission gate for a batch of tool calls (WP22.1 / C05, L03).
 *
 * Source: Codex `codex-rs/core/src/tools/parallel.rs:107-111`. A tool that
 * declares itself parallel-safe takes a **read** lock — several of them hold it
 * at once and genuinely run together. A tool that does not takes a **write**
 * lock, which excludes everything else. One lock therefore expresses both halves
 * of the contract: "independent reads actually run in parallel" and "a write to
 * a shared path is exclusive".
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and each is pinned by a test:
 *
 *  - **Fair, i.e. write-preferring.** Waiters are served in arrival order, so a
 *    writer that arrived is never overtaken by a reader that came later. A
 *    reader-friendly lock would let a stream of reads starve one write forever,
 *    and the write is the call whose ordering actually matters.
 *  - **Reads behind a waiting write do not jump the queue.** A read may enter
 *    only while no writer is waiting ahead of it — this is the same rule as
 *    above, seen from the reader's side.
 *  - **Release is idempotent.** A worker that releases twice (a `finally` plus
 *    an explicit call, say) must not hand the lock to a second caller.
