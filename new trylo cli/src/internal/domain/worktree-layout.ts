/**
 * Managed-worktree path layout (WP25.2 / C79, L70).
 *
 * Source: Codex `codex-rs/worktree/src/paths.rs:26-29` (bucket allocation) and
 * `codex-rs/worktree/src/lib.rs:363-397` (layout recognition).
 *
 * A managed checkout sits exactly two levels below the pool root:
 *
 *   <root>/<bucket>/<repository name>
 *
 * `bucket` is four ASCII hex digits, taken from the head of a random
 * identifier. Two consequences are load-bearing and each is pinned by a test:
 *
 *  - **Allocation cannot collide by construction.** A bucket is claimed with a
 *    create-that-must-not-already-exist, so two sessions racing never share a
 *    directory, and no registry has to be locked or read first.
 *  - **Membership is decidable from the path alone.** Any directory two levels
 *    down whose first component is four hex digits is ours; anything else is
 *    not. That is what keeps a hand-made worktree — one holding work the user
 *    never committed — out of `list` and therefore out of `remove`.
 *
 * Pure: no process, no clock, no filesystem. Callers pass canonical paths, and
 * this module compares text the way `std::path::Path::strip_prefix` does.
