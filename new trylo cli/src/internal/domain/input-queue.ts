 *    leading steers are promoted together at the next safe boundary and the
 *    step budget is reset, so a person redirecting the run is not charged for
 *    the steps the run already spent going the wrong way.
 *  - **`queue`** — "say this when you are free". One message per gap, promoted
 *    only when the turn would otherwise have gone idle, so queued text can
 *    never preempt a tool result the model is still owed.
 *
 * The boundary is *not* decided here. This module says what may be promoted and
 * how much budget it costs; the loop decides when a boundary has been reached
 * and the reducer refuses the input outside one. Three owners, one rule.
