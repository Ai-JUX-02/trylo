/**
 * What a grant *is*, and therefore what it may not be used for (WP03.1 / F02).
 *
 * The audit line this answers is blunt: the durable tooling file ledger and the
 * temporary session grant cache have different lifetimes, and treating one as
 * the other is how a permission stops meaning anything. So the three kinds of
 * permission-bearing thing this CLI has are named here once, with the lifetime
 * and the consumer each one is for, and one rule is made checkable:
 *
 *   - a grant of kind A never answers a question of kind B.
 *
 * That rule is not documentation. {@link grantSatisfies} is the only function in
 * the codebase allowed to turn "a grant exists" into "this call is authorised",
 * and it refuses every cross-kind pairing. A caller that wants to know whether it
 * may proceed has to say which kind of question it is asking, so widening a
 * grant's reach is a change to this file rather than a change to a lookup.
