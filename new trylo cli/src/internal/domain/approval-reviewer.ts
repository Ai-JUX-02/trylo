/**
 * Automatic approval review (C67).
 *
 * Source of the semantics: Codex `core/src/guardian/decision.rs` at commit
 * `73a1148c9c775c2a4616ce5096291740a00ed68a`. Three things are copied:
 *
 *  - the reviewer's answer has three shapes, not two. `allow` and `deny` settle
 *    it; `ask_user` is not a decision but a *refusal to decide*, and it is what
 *    the existing user flow is for. Upstream's own summary line is the rule
 *    worth keeping verbatim in spirit: no contributor is never an implicit
 *    allow.
 *  - `None` (nobble registered) and `AskUser` both fall through to the user
 *    flow unless something forces a review. A missing reviewer therefore
 *    degrades to the behaviour that already exists, which is the only safe way
 *    for a component that may not be installed to be wrong.
 *  - a full-access turn short-circuits to approved, but only after the request
 *    validates. Full access skips the *question*, never the validation.
 *
 * What is deliberately not copied: the reviewer is a prompted subagent upstream,
 * with a compaction-aware context, an analytics event per decision and a V2 flag
 * that is off by default. This module carries none of that. What it carries is
 * the part that is load-bearing: an approval produced by a reviewer is
 * `once`-scoped and never enters the grant cache, so a reviewer cannot write
 * itself a permission slip by approving something.
