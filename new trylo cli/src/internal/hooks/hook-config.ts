/**
 * WP17.1 — hook configuration, matching, and selection.
 *
 * Pure mechanical layer ported from the old CLI, same language, no runtime
 * borrowed: `matchesPattern` (`utils/hooks.ts`), matcher grouping and
 * source-priority ordering (`hooksSettings.ts` / `hooksConfigManager.ts`),
 * disable scoping (`hooksConfigSnapshot.ts`).
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* ported: `getAllHooks` (it reaches into
 * AppState/bootstrap/settings — the old runtime's big state steward, which
 * the work package forbids copying) and the executors themselves (they live
 * behind the ports in `hook-ports.ts`, so the config layer never spawns).
 *
 * Matching is call-site supplied: the runner hands over one string per event
 * (tool name for tool events, agent type for subagent events, path for file
 * events). Which field a matcher applies to is therefore the trigger site's
 * documented choice, not a second matcher language hiding in this file.

/**
 * Whether one hook's matcher accepts one trigger value.
 *
 * Ported branch-for-branch from the old CLI `matchesPattern`
 * (`trylo cli/src/utils/hooks.ts`, verified 2026-10-06):
 *
 * 1. Absent/empty/`*` match everything.
 * 2. A matcher of only `[a-zA-Z0-9_|]` is matched EXACTLY — pipe branches by
 *    membership, a bare word by equality — and returns immediately. There is
 *    deliberately no regex fallthrough here: `Bash` must not fire on
 *    `BashTool`, and `Write|Edit` must not fire on `WriteFile`. An earlier
 *    revision of this file fell through to the regex and over-triggered;
 *    the truth-table test below pins the exact semantics.
 * 3. Anything else is a regular expression over the value; an invalid
 *    expression matches nothing.
 *
 * Two deliberate deviations, both documented rather than silently copied:
 * the old CLI normalises old→new tool renames (`normalizeLegacyToolName`)
 * and also tests regexes against legacy aliases (`getLegacyToolNames`).
 * This CLI's trigger values are its own canonical names with no legacy
 * aliases, so there is nothing to normalise — porting that map would be
 * cargo-culting another CLI's rename history.
