/**
 * WP09.2 — what the digest must survive with.
 *
 * The extractive digest used to keep the *head* of the replaced range and drop
 * the tail first. For a second compaction that is exactly backwards: the head
 * carries the task's standing constraints, but the tail carries the most
 * recent state before the window boundary — the last steer, the last tool
 * outcome — and losing it first is how a task quietly drifts off its
 * constraints after two compactions (WP09.2's acceptance case).
 *
 * The contract now: the digest keeps the head (constraints, goals) AND the
 * tail (recent state), and elides the middle with an explicit count. Written
 * against the unfixed summarizer first (red evidence, WP09 交接记录).
