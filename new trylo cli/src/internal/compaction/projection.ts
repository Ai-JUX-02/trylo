/**
 * The two views over one journal.
 *
 * `listTranscript` is what a UI, a journal dump or an auditor reads: everything
 * that was ever said, including what a summary replaced.
 * `projectForPrompt` is what the model gets: the newest summary plus whatever
 * happened after it.
 *
 * They are deliberately different results over the same bytes. The whole point
 * of compaction is "the model's past is shorter than the record's past"; a
 * projection that quietly agreed with `listTranscript` would mean the filter
 * never ran.
 *
 * Both views validate the payload of every `transcript_item` they project: the
 * byte-level checks (checksum, sequence, version) prove the journal was written
 * by a writer of this format, not that every payload still matches its type.
 * A store that has already validated its records never trips this — the guard
 * is for the paths that have not been proven, and an invalid payload reaches
 * the model's view only as a failure, never as a guessed item.
