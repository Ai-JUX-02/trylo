/**
 * Subagent worktree isolation (WP25.2 / L28).
 *
 * Source: Codex `codex-rs/exec/src/worktree.rs` (allocation around the run) and
 * `codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs:1087-1091` (bind the owner once the run has an id).
 * The old CLI's `AgentTool` worktree branch was the TS-side precedent.
 *
 * The whole point is that a child agent cannot edit its parent's working tree:
 * it gets a checkout of its own, and the parent can take the diff afterwards.
 * Two consequences follow, and both are the reason this is a lease rather than
 * a convenience call:
 *
 *  - **The lease is bound to the child, not to the code.** Isolation that
 *    outlives the child is not isolation; the whole point of a worktree is
 *    that the diff can be handed back and the worktree released. `release`
 *    therefore refuses exactly as hard as it acquired.
 *  - **A failed lease is a refusal, never a fallback.** Running the child in
 *    the parent's directory "because the worktree could not be created" would
 *    hand it the parent's uncommitted files with a different name on them. The
 *    caller gets `ok: false` and decides.
 *
 * Neither path decides *when* a child should be isolated — that is the caller's
 * policy. This module owns the lifetime.
