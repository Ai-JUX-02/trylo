// Kept under `integration/`, not `loop/`: this file pins that the loop and the

// `adapters/**` (quality gate step 4). `integration/**` is the one layer that
// may name both.

/**
 * Cross-implementation pins for the two rules that had more than one home.
 *
 * A duplication is only dangerous while the copies still agree, so the pin has
 * to compare the copies *against each other* — asserting each one's own
 * behaviour lets them drift apart unnoticed, which is exactly what happened:
 * `loop` decided "answered" by id while `session-store` decided it by position,
 * and the id-based reading hid an orphan in the one case that produces one. The
 * review that found it called for a shared owner plus a test that holds both
 * sides; the owner is now `protocol/`, and this file is that test.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `protocol/` on purpose: a test that reaches
 * upward into `loop` and `adapters` is a cross-layer test, and putting it in the
 * shared layer would make that layer depend on its consumers.
 *
 * Every case below is a case where the two former answers disagreed.
