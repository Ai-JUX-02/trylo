 *
 * Reuse (mechanical layer only, types stay Trylo-owned):
 * - Codex `utils/image/src/lib.rs` — `data_url_from_bytes`, the
 *   png/jpeg/gif/webp passthrough set (`can_preserve_source_bytes`), the
 *   `high`/`original` detail split, `MAX_DIMENSION 2048`;
 * - legacy `FileReadTool.ts:188` (`IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`), `:250` (image media
 *   types), `constants/apiLimits.ts:22` (5 MiB base64 hard limit, from which
 *   the raw cap below is derived).
