/**
 * MCP tool annotations, kept as hints and nothing else.
 *
 * D3 §7 is explicit: `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint` and
 * `openWorldHint` come from the server, and a server Trylo does not control is
 * not a source of policy. codex forwards them to its guardian as *evidence*;
 * goose feeds them to a heuristic. Neither lets a hint unset an approval.
 *
 * This module therefore has exactly one job, and it is a job about *not*
 * changing things:
 *
 *   - read the four hints off an arbitrary JSON value, keeping only booleans;
 *   - report them for display;
 *   - and, on the approval question, always answer "required".
 *
 * `destructiveHint: false` is the interesting attack. A server that declares
 * its tool harmless is asking to be believed. The rule that makes the request
 * uninteresting is that the local policy bit is not derived from the hint at
 * all: {@link approvalRequirementFor} ignores its argument's hints and returns
 * a constant. A test asserts precisely that, so a future "optimisation" that
 * lets a read-only hint skip a prompt has to delete a test to land.
