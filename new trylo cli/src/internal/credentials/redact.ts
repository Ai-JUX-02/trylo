/**
 * The single redaction point for the credentials package (WP §2.6).

 * Every string this package could hand to a human or to JSON — a failure
 * `detail`, a status row, a public export, a log line — is expected to pass
 * through {@link redactText} with the set of secrets currently known to the
 * ledger. The guarantee is structural rather than hopeful:
 *
 *  - The public views ({@link import("../ports/credentials.js").CredentialStatusRow},
 *    `CredentialPublicEntry`, `CredentialPublicView`) are *shaped* without a
 *    `secret` field, so no code path can put one there by accident.
 *  - Redaction is the second layer of defence, for text that was assembled from
 *    free-form input: a caller that interpolates a user-supplied value into a
 *    `detail` still cannot leak a stored secret through it.
 *
 * A secret is replaced by {@link REDACTED} — deliberately a fixed marker, not a
 * masked prefix, because a partial secret in a bug report is still a leak.
