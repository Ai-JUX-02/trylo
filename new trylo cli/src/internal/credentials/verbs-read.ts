 * only look at it. The split is not cosmetic: every read shares the same two
 * questions — is the id known, and can both scopes be read — and keeping them
 * together is what keeps that pair stated once. `resolve.ts` owns the rules
 * themselves; these are the port-shaped adapters over them, and they stay thin
 * on purpose.
