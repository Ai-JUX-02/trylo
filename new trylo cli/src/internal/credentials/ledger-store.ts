 * What the port's verbs need from a *ledger*: read one scope, replace one scope.
 *
 * Expressed as a domain interface rather than as the file adapter directly, so
 * the verbs are testable against an in-memory ledger and the file backend is one
 * implementation among others. The relation to `CredentialBackend` (the
 * byte-level contract in the port) is deliberate:
 *
 *  - `CredentialBackend` moves one provider's entry — the shape a keyring wants.
 *  - `LedgerStore` moves a whole document — the shape a file wants, because a
 *    file is replaced wholesale (lock, rename) rather than edited in place.
 *
 * The `keyring` adapter implements the port directly; the file backend
 * implements `LedgerStore`; the in-memory ledger (test + fake keyring) also
 * implements `LedgerStore`.
