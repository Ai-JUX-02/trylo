/**
 * The OS keyring driver contract (WP 三轨 T3 §5).
 *
 * A driver answers one question — "can this machine store a secret under a
 * name, and give it back?" — for one backing store (Windows Credential
 * Manager, macOS Keychain, libsecret). It moves *opaque text blobs*; it knows
 * nothing about ledgers, documents or checksums. The document codec lives in
 * `adapters/credentials/keyring-store.ts`, so every driver automatically gets
 * the same fail-closed decode the file backend uses.
 *
 * Error discipline (mirrors codex's `keyring-store` normalization, D6 §5):
 *
 *  - **"never stored" is not an error.** `read` returns `undefined` when the
 *    target does not exist — `keyring::Error::NoEntry => Ok(None)`.
 *  - **`probe` never throws.** Unavailability is a *value* carrying a reason,
 *    because the prefer-keyring selection must degrade to the file ledger with
 *    a warning (acceptance #1), not crash.
 *  - **read/write/remove may throw.** A keyring that exists but fails is an
 *    operation failure, fail closed — never a silent fall back to a file the
 *    user did not choose.
 *  - **Every throw message is secret-free by construction.** Messages name the
 *    operation, the target and a size or OS error code — never blob content.
