 * The whole point of this verb is a sentence that must never become true: an
 * endpoint authenticating with a key that was issued for a different host. So
 * the three assertions that matter are (1) it returns the named account's key,
 * (2) it never moves the family's current pointer, and (3) it never answers with
 * an environment-declared key when a specific account was asked for.
