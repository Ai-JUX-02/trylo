/**
 * The one property this file exists for (WP22.2b / C44).
 *
 * Codex states it in a comment at `core/src/agent/role.rs:2`: a role may
 * customise the child or reduce its capabilities, but must never replace the
 * parent session's authority. Every test here is one way a role file could
 * quietly break that — a wish list naming a tool the parent cannot use, a turn
 * ceiling above the parent's, a model the parent never agreed to.
