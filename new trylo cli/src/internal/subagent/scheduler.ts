 * hand and no lifecycle test has to race real time to prove a timeout.

 * readability discipline allows for ambient sources (WP-CLI-N3: "ID、时钟和

/**
 * The shipped scheduler: one `setTimeout`, deliberately *not* `unref`'d.
 *
 * The obvious alternative — unref, so a pending subagent timeout cannot hold a
 * headless process open — breaks the contract this seam exists to provide. Both
 * call sites promise "this resolves after `timeoutMs`", and a timer that cannot
 * keep the event loop alive cannot fire on its own: when the awaited work holds
 * no other handle (a provider stream whose `next()` never settles is exactly
 * that shape), the loop drains, the timer never fires, and the wait hangs
 * forever. That is the one situation the timeout exists for.
 *
 * Holding the process open is not the leak it looks like. Every timer this
 * scheduler hands out is cancelled when its subagent is released or reaches a
 * terminal (`governance.ts`), so a live subagent keeps the process alive — which
 * is correct, it *is* still running — and a finished one leaves nothing behind.
