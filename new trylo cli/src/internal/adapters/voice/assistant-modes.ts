/**
 * Advanced assistant modes ledger (WP19.3: A10 voice/assistant/Kairos/ultraplan).
 *
 * None of these modes is implemented here, and this ledger exists so that
 * fact stays visible: each entry names the legacy source, why it cannot be
 * claimed as done, and what would have to arrive first. A stub copied into
 * the tree would read as a feature in every listing that counts files — this
 * table reads as the absence it is.
 *
 * Paths are repo-relative to `C:/work/demo-ws/trylo cli`, the only baseline this
 * package may draw these modes from.
