/**
 * Per-provider capability declarations (WP PW-1, design decision D1).
 *
 * A capability is something the *adapter itself* declares at runtime, not
 * something the CLI infers, guesses or degrades into. The rule that makes this
 * file worth having is a negative one: an adapter that does not declare a
 * capability is asked for nothing that needs it, and a caller that asks anyway
 * is refused with a name — never handed a silent approximation.
 *
 * Three facts are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **the key set is closed.** A capability that is not one of
 *    `CAPABILITY_KEYS` cannot be spelled, so "we support something undefined"
 *    is not a state this matrix can be in;
 *  - **an empty model list means "not declared", not "no models".** An
 *    OpenAI-compatible endpoint's catalogue is a fact about the endpoint, and
 *    this process does not ask it. Inventing plausible model names would be
 *    the single most useful-looking lie in the package;
 *  - **refusal is a value, not an exception.** `requireCapability` returns the
 *    denial so a caller can render it, fold it into a doctor row or turn it
 *    into an exit code without catching anything.
