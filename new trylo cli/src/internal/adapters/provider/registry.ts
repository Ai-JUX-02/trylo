/**
 * The provider registry: what exists, what it can do, which one is selected.
 *
 * Two kinds of provider live here and the difference is load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **built-in** — the four ids the CLI has always accepted. They are declared
 *    here rather than assumed, so "what can `fixture` do" is answered by the
 *    same matrix as everything else instead of by a special case in a caller;
 *  - **declared** — entries the person added in `providers.json`. They may name
 *    a new endpoint and its capabilities, but they may *not* redefine a
 *    built-in id: `decodeDocument` refuses that, and a shipped provider that
 *    could be silently re-pointed would make "offline and deterministic" a
 *    claim about a file rather than a fact.
 *
 * Selection is a pure function of (requested id, document `selected`, the
 * built-in default). It is resolved once and handed out as one object, so no
 * caller can end up with the endpoint of one provider and the model of another.
 *
 * A missing file is *not* an error: it is the state every machine is in before
 * anyone declares anything, and it must behave exactly as today. A file that
 * exists but cannot be trusted is an error, and is reported with the code that
 * says why — the same discipline the config loader already applies to
 * `config.json`.
