 * Reading and validating the watch rows in the shared schedule record

 * ## Why this is separate from the store
 *
 * Deciding what a row *means* and deciding what the store *does about it* are
 * different questions, and mixing them is how a file format starts leaking into
 * behaviour. Everything here is a pure function of bytes on disk: a hand-edited,
 * truncated or half-written row has to become "not a watch" rather than a watch
 * with `undefined` in a field that is later read as a timestamp.
 *
 * ## What "not a watch" means here
 *
 * `undefined` — the row is skipped. Not a default-filled watch, not a thrown
 * error. A record shared with cron schedules may legitimately contain rows this
 * version does not understand, and one of them must not stop the others from
 * being listed.
