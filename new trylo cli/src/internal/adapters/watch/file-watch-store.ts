 * The durable watch store (WP26 / A07).

 * ## Where the records live, and why
 *
 * In the **schedule store's** file, as rows of its own kind. A watch is an
 * occurrence with a condition attached; a parallel file would mean two writers,
 * two locks, and a way for a watch to outlive the schedule record that would have
 * fired it.
 *
 * ## How "fires once" is actually guaranteed
 *
 * By an **occurrence row appended next to the watch** when it fires, keyed by the
 * derived id `watch_<id>@<fireMomentMs>`. A watch that is still `armed` but whose
 * occurrence exists has fired, whatever the watch row says — which is what makes
 * the guarantee survive a restart and survive a hand-edited file, rather than
 * resting on a `fired: true` flag in memory.
 *
 * Both kinds derive their occurrence from the watch's own identity via
 * `domain/watch.ts::watchFireMoment` — a deadline from its own `atMs`, a
 * condition watch from its `createdAtMs`. Deriving a condition watch from the
 * moment the fire was observed instead would break crash recovery: the second
 * derivation would land on a different moment, find nothing, and fire again.
