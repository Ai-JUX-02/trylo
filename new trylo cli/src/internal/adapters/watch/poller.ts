/**
 * Polling armed watches, once per scheduler tick (WP26 / A07).
 *
 * ## Why this is not inside the scheduler loop
 *
 * The loop's job is the lease, the tick budget and the crash windows. A watch is
 * a different shape — it has no fixed fire moment, it fires when something
 * outside says so — and folding that in would make the loop's tick about two
 * unrelated things. This is a step the loop *calls*, so the loop stays the single
 * thing that owns "what happens once per tick".
 *
 * ## The order that matters
 *
 * Check the occurrence record **before** enqueueing. A condition that stays true
 * for ten minutes is evaluated on every tick, and without that check each
 * evaluation would leave a message. Checking first means a watch whose fire is
 * already recorded is skipped entirely, and the burst the whole design exists to
 * prevent cannot start.
 *
 * That check is only possible because the occurrence id is derived — see
 * `domain/watch.ts`. A random id per fire would make it unanswerable.
