/**
 * One registry entry -> one connected-capable client, for all three transports.
 *
 * The claim "this build speaks stdio, http and sse" is only true if something
 * actually branches on `entry.transport`, and this is that one place. Keeping it
 * apart from the pool means the pool never has to know which transport it is
 * starting: it asks for a client and gets one, or gets a failure it can record.
 *
 * Two shapes are deliberately *not* produced here:
 *
 *  - **No defaulting of a missing url.** A remote entry without a url cannot be
 *    dialled, and guessing one from the command would be inventing
 *    configuration. It is a refusal with a code, reported per server.
 *  - **No throwing.** A build that cannot be made is data, because the caller's
 *    job is to keep every other server running (see `pool.ts`).
 *
 * The seams exist so the pool's own tests can drive it without a child process;
 * production passes nothing and gets the real clients.
