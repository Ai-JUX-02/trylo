/**
 * Scoped checkpoint comparison and restore (WP11.2, L37).
 *
 * Mechanical reuse of the old `fileHistory.ts` ideas — per-file backup
 * entries, "file did not exist" as an explicit state rather than a guess,
 * and compare-before-write — over the new whole-workspace snapshots. The
 * difference from both the old rewind and the current full `applyRestore`
 * is the scope: only paths named in `scope` are ever written or removed.
 * A file the user created after the checkpoint that is not in scope is
 * reported as kept, never deleted. That is what makes "rewind this task"
 * disjoint from "wipe my other work".
 *
 * Pure planning plus a small injected-IO applier. Hashing and directory
 * reads stay with the caller (the store, the walk); this module only sees
 * `{ path, sha256, bytes }` rows.
