/**
 * The three ceilings WP12 declared in `ports/language-server.ts` but never
 * enforced: how many locations one answer may keep, how many bytes one
 * message may carry, and how long an unused connection may live.
 *
 * Two layering rules shape this file:
 *
 *   - no second JSON-RPC parser. Inbound framing stays the library's; this
 *     file only scans `Content-Length` declarations so a message that
 *     *declares* more than the cap never gets its body allocated. A message
 *     with no parseable headers passes through untouched and fails, if it
 *     fails, on the library's terms — exactly as before this file existed.
 *   - limit failures travel as named errors (`LspMessageTooLarge`), the same
 *     shape as the existing `LspServerExited`/`LspCancelled` markers, so the
 *     single error mapper in `lsp-request.ts` stays the only translator.
 *
 * Enforcement itself is a decorator over the port (`withQueryLimits`), not
 * code inside the lifecycle: the client owns starting, stopping and crash
 * settling, and this owns the ceilings. A ceiling that lived in the client
 * could only be tested by starting a process; on the port boundary every
 * rule below is assertable against a stub.
