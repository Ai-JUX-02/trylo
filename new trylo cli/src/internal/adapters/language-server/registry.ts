/**
 * Which language server answers, and whether it is allowed to start.
 *
 * Reused from the legacy CLI's `services/lsp/LSPServerManager.ts` +
 * `config.ts` (~500 lines) in shape only. The mechanics worth keeping are the
 * two that were got right there: a server is matched by **file extension** rather
 * than by "whatever was connected first", and a project gets its own set rather
 * than the process-wide set. The rest was not portable and is not here:
 *
 *   - configuration came from the plugin system, which Trylo does not have;
 *   - the manager was a module-level singleton with its own init state machine
 *     and its own shutdown. Trylo has exactly one owner per lifecycle, and a
 *     hidden singleton that starts servers during CLI startup is precisely the
 *     thing the cost contract forbids — a plain `trylo` run must not spawn a
 *     language server.
 *
 * So the registry is inert: it *describes* which server would serve a project
 * and does not start anything. Starting is the client's business, and starting is
 * gated on authorization, because running a program is a side effect even when
 * the question being answered is read-only.
