/**
 * Keeping a language server's copy of a file current.
 *
 * Split out of `client.ts` because it owns something the connection does not:
 * the *version history* of every document the server has been shown. That state
 * is what decides between `didOpen` and `didChange`, and getting it wrong is
 * silent — the protocol treats a second `didOpen` for a held URI as an error,
 * and a server that receives one may simply stop tracking the file.
 *
 * Why it matters beyond tidiness: a language server resolves positions against
 * the documents it has been shown. A query about a file it never received comes
 * back as a confident empty answer, which reads as a fact about the code.
 * Handing it the text first is the difference between "no definition here" and
 * "I never looked".
