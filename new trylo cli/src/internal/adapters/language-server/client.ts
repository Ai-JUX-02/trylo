/**
 * The one module allowed to know a language server exists as a process.
 *
 * Everything upstream — the tools, the loop, the journal — speaks the
 * `LanguageServerPort` contract in `ports/language-server.ts`. This file and its
 * siblings are the only place `vscode-*` types appear, and they convert at the
 * boundary. That containment is not tidiness: it is what makes the transport
 * replaceable and a stored result stable when the protocol package changes.
 *
 * Reused from the legacy CLI's `services/lsp/` (LSPClient / LSPServerInstance /
 * LSPServerManager, ~2 400 lines). What was kept is the mechanical shape —
 * spawn, stdio framing, initialize handshake, capability bookkeeping, shutdown.
 * What was dropped is everything that made it a second runtime: the legacy global
 * config singleton, its logger, its own permission path, and its restart policy.
 * Those are now the caller's to inject, because permission has exactly one owner
 * in Trylo and a language server that quietly started itself would be a second.
 *
 * Two facts about the current dependency versions shape this file, both found by
 * probe rather than by reading the legacy source:
 *   - the entry is `vscode-jsonrpc/node`, not `vscode-jsonrpc/node.js`; 9.x
 *     dropped the `.js` subpath from its exports map;
 *   - `connection.listen()` must happen before any request, or the first
 *     `sendRequest` throws `Call listen() first.`
