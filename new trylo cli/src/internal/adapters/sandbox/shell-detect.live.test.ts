/**
 * WP05.1's real-process half: the argv in `shell-detect.test.ts` is observed
 * here rather than only well-shaped. Every platform fact in that file is an
 * injected array, which is what makes "a machine with no PowerShell"
 * assertable anywhere — and also what makes it possible for a set of flags to
 * look right and run wrong. These tests are the correction for that, and each
 * was written after a measurement on this machine contradicted what the pure
 * version had asserted.
 *
 * A shell that is genuinely absent is SKIPPED, not failed: a skip says "not on
 * this machine", an assertion failure says "broken". Getting that backwards
 * would report a product defect on every machine that lacks PowerShell.
 *
 * That skip is also the whole reason this file can be trusted on a machine whose
 * `bash` is WSL's rather than Git's. Measured: `resolveShell` picks by PATH
 * order, and this machine has resolved both — `C:\Windows\system32\bash.EXE`
 * (WSL, seconds to cold-start, and it holds the temporary directory open long
 * enough to make the cleanup below fail with EPERM) and Git's `bash.EXE` at
 * 51ms. A machine-dependent answer inside an assertion turns a red gate into a
 * mystery, so what is asserted here is the SHAPE OF THE REFUSAL and the timing
 * budget, never which `bash` happened to win.

/**
 * The refusal for a name this build does not know, at the boundary.
 *
 * `ShellKind` is a compile-time union, so this call is a type error on purpose —
 * `@ts-expect-error` is the assertion, and it is a real one: if the parameter
 * ever widens to `string`, tsc reports `TS2578` (unused `@ts-expect-error`) and
 * this goes red, because the runtime check would then be untested.
 *
 * Red example, measured before the check existed: this threw
 * `TypeError: PROGRAM_NAMES[kind] is not iterable` from inside the lookup —
 * the one failure shape this package is not allowed to have, and the reason
 * `unknown_shell_kind` had been a member of the failure union that nothing in
 * the repository could produce.
