/**
 * Turning a program name into the file that will actually be started.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * The PTY sidecar is a separate process with its own idea of what `PATH` means:
 * `portable-pty` builds its Windows `CreateProcessW` call from the environment it
 * was handed, and once that environment is cleared the sidecar's own search has
 * nothing to search with. A bare `node` that starts fine under `child_process`
 * would fail there — and it would fail *differently* from how it fails, which is
 * the dangerous part.
 *
 * So the CLI resolves the program before handing it over, and the sidecar is
 * told an absolute path. That is not a second search policy: the rules below
 * come from the same `PATH`/`PATHEXT` the rest of the CLI uses, and
 * `lookupExecutable` in `executable.ts` remains the authority on *what kind* of
 * program a name refers to. This module only answers *which file*.
 *
 * The alternative — letting the sidecar search — was rejected because it makes
 * two answers to "what runs" where only one has been through the sandbox's
 * rules, and the one that has not is the one that actually starts a process.
