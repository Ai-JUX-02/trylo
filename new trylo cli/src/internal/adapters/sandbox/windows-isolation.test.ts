/**
 * WP04 — the fail-closed contract.
 *
 * The dangerous shape for this adapter is a quiet degradation: a machine with
 * no sandbox installed, a broken fence, or a helper that refuses to start must
 * all end in "the command did not run", never in the command running anyway.
 * Every test below targets that, because it is the property no probe can
 * demonstrate on a machine where the sandbox happens to work.
 *
 * The real-machine behaviour (WFP blocking a direct connect, an ACL denying a
 * write, the helper executing a program) is proven by the scripts in
 * `docs/02-分期工程产出/P00-工程地基与质量门禁/evidence/2026-10-04-WP04-probes/`.
 * These tests are the platform-independent half.
