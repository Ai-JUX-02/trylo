/**
 * WP05.2: what the tokenizer does to a Windows path.
 *
 * Written as red cases first — every expectation below was a *quote of observed
 * behaviour* before the fix, so the fix had to move each one:
 *
 *   "C:\Users\binaries\node.exe"  ->  ["C:Usersbinariesnode.exe"]   separators deleted
 *   "C:\b\n\v\t\f\r\a\0test"      ->  ["C:bnvtfra0test"]            letters survived
 *   "\\\\server\\share\\file.txt"  ->  ["\\serversharefile.txt"]      UNC, deleted
 *   "dir\"                        ->  undefined                    dangling escape
 *
 * Two things the measurements ruled out, worth keeping in the record because
 * both were believed before they were checked:
 *
 *  - The letters survive. `\b` and `\n` in a path are deleted as separators,
 *    NOT turned into backspace and newline. A control-character bug would need
 *    a completely different fix.
 *  - Quoted (`"C:\Program Files\..."`) and forward-slash (`C:/...`) paths
 *    already worked whole. The gap was specifically the *bare backslash* word,
 *    so "all absolute paths fail" was too strong.
 *
 * What the fix is NOT: a platform flag, a general separator rewrite, or a
 * blanket `shell: true`. `\` is still an escape character everywhere except
 * where the word is recognisably a drive path or a UNC opening, so a POSIX
 * command cannot change meaning because of this.
