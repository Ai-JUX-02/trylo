/**
 * The in-memory *fake* keyring.
 *
 * This is not a real OS keyring and must never be assembled in production. It
 * exists to prove one property the WP asks for explicitly: the port can be
 * backed by something other than a file, and login/status/logout behave the same
 * across backends. Its `kind` is reported as `keyring`, so a test can assert the
 * credential really travels through the keyring path.
 *
 * The storage is a `LedgerStore` over a private map — the same document shape the
 * file backend uses — because the port resolves *ledgers*, and a keyring that
 * stored a different shape would not be testing the same code path.
 *
 * `unavailable: true` models "a keyring was requested but no adapter is attached"
 * (WP §0: `get` hitting keyring with no implementation → `keyring_unavailable`).
 * Every read and write then fails closed with that code, rather than falling back
 * to the file store — a silent fallback would store a secret somewhere the user
 * did not ask for.
