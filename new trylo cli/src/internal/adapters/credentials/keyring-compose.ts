/**
 * The prefer-keyring composition (WP 三轨 T3 §5 acceptance #1):
 *
 * **when an OS keyring is available it wins; when it is not, degrade to the
 * file ledger and say so** — the report carries a non-empty `reason` for the
 * caller to surface as one `warning` (the port's `Result` has no warning
 * channel, so the degradation is a *selection-time* fact, decided before any
 * secret moves).
 *
 * The line this module refuses to cross, inherited from `compose.ts`:
 * degrading *at selection time* (no keyring on this machine) writes nothing
 * anywhere and only changes which empty store is used. Degrading *mid-operation*
 * (the keyring exists but a read or write fails) would move a secret into a
 * file the user did not choose — so `keyring-store.ts` fails closed instead,
 * and this module never retries against the file ledger after a *failure*.
 *
 * Read order is a separate question from failure, and the two were conflated
 * once (WP §3-D6 / §4 W-KEY #4 spell them apart): **a miss is not a failure.**
 * When the keyring is the selected backend but has never stored a scope, the
 * read defers to the file ledger (`prefer-store.ts`), so opting in cannot cost
 * a user the credential they already had; writes still go to the keyring only.
 * A driver that exists and throws is still an operation failure, never a quiet
 * file read.
 *
 * `compose.ts` itself is untouched: the three selection semantics its tests pin
 * (absent → file, attached → store, `attached:false` → fail closed) and the
 * ≤60-line `createCredentialPort` source scan all hold byte for byte. This
 * factory composes *on top of* `createCredentialPort`.
 *
 * Wiring note (待接线, HANDOFF §5): production activation is one call-site swap
 * in `surface/cli/credentials-wiring.ts` — owned by the收口轨, not by this track.
