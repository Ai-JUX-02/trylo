/**
 * The read order of the prefer-keyring selection (WP `2026-09-16-WP-传统CLI-
 * 交付面收尾波` §3-D6 / §4 W-KEY #4).
 *
 * Two rules, and the asymmetry between them is the whole point:
 *
 *  - **reads ask the keyring first and defer to the file ledger on a miss.** A
 *    machine that already holds file-ledger credentials keeps them after a user
 *    opts in: a scope the keyring has *never stored* (`existed: false`, the
 *    codex `NoEntry => Ok(None)` normalization) falls through to the file.
 *    Opting in must not cost a user the credential they already had.
 *  - **writes go to the keyring only.** Once the keyring is the selected
 *    backend no new secret lands in a file — the fallback is a *read* path, not
 *    a second place secrets accumulate.
 *
 * What is deliberately **not** here: a fallback after a keyring *failure*. A
 * driver that exists but throws stays a failure (`read_failed` / `write_failed`
 * from `keyring-store.ts`), because quietly serving a file the user did not
 * choose is how a secret ends up somewhere nobody expected. A miss is not a
 * failure, and a failure is not a miss.
 *
 * `existed` — not "the document happens to have records" — is the hit test. A
 * keyring document that was written and later emptied by a `logout` is still
 * *stored*, so it stays authoritative and the file's older copy is not
 * resurrected behind the user's back.
