/**
 * The one factory that assembles a `CredentialPort`.
 *
 * Kept to wiring only (≤60 lines, adversarial #12): the verbs live in
 * `credentials/verbs.ts`, the storage in `adapters/credentials/**`. This module
 * decides *which* storage backs the port and hands the verbs their dependencies.
 *
 * Backend selection is explicit and defaults to the file ledger:
 *
 *  - **no `keyring`** → the file store. A keyring that is merely *absent* is not
 *    an error; the file ledger is the documented default (WP §0: 未挂 keyring 时
 *    走 file，不得报 `keyring_unavailable`).
 *  - **`keyring: { attached: true }`** → the attached keyring store.
 *  - **`keyring: { attached: false }`** → a port whose every read fails with
 *    `keyring_unavailable`. This models "the deployment asked for a keyring but
 *    none is wired", which must fail closed rather than silently writing the
 *    secret to a file the user did not choose.
 *
 * No real OS keyring is attached here, and this module never spawns a process or
 * reads the live environment.
