/**
 * Ending a process *tree*, not just a process.
 *
 * # Why this module exists
 *
 * Every other module here kills one pid. That is not the same act, and on
 * Windows the difference is not academic — `probe-c13d` (evidence
 * `2026-10-05-WP07/01-c13-kill-current.log`) shows a `cmd.exe` → `node` →
 * `node` chain where `child.kill()` removes the shell from `tasklist` while the
 * **grandchild stays listed and still runs**: it wrote its marker file eight
 * seconds after the "kill". A caller told "stopped" would then wait forever for
 * output a surviving grandchild will never send.
 *
 * # Where the mechanism comes from
 *
 * Codex's `utils/pty/src/process_group.rs` is the obvious candidate and it is
 * **the wrong file on this platform**: every function in it is `#[cfg(unix)]`
 * with a `#[cfg(not(unix))]` no-op twin, so on Windows it does nothing at all.
 * Its real Windows implementation is `utils/pty/src/win/job.rs` (a Job Object
 * with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`), which Codex reaches from Rust.
 *
 * Reaching a Job Object from Node needs either a native addon or a helper
 * process, and this repository has no native addon and no Rust build for this
 * path (verified: no `binding.gyp`, no `.node` artifacts). Codex itself takes
 * the helper route when a Job Object is not in hand — `exec-server` and
 * `hooks` both fall back to `taskkill /T /F`
 * (`evidence/2026-10-05-WP07/02-c13-taskkill-fix.log` shows it removing the
 * whole tree here). So the mechanism below is the same one, reached the same
 * way, and it is the shortest route that is actually runnable today.
 *
 * What is given up, stated plainly: `taskkill` is a helper process, so a tree
 * can in principle outrun it, and it reports through an exit code rather than
 * telling us which descendant it reached. The Job Object route would be
 * stronger. It is recorded as `OPEN-WP07-2`, not quietly treated as done.

 * that makes it true is observing the group gone, so that observation is the
 * gate on the success value — and when the platform will not let us observe
 * (no seam available, or still alive after the force), the result is a failure
 * with survivors named, which is what the caller needs in order to stop
