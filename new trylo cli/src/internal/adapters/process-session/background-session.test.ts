/**
 * Background sessions addressed as `ps` / `logs` / `attach` / `kill` (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * The cases here start **real processes** rather than faking a registry. That is
 * the point of the feature: `ps` lying about what is running, `logs` reporting
 * output that was never produced, and `kill` claiming success while a process
 * keeps going are all failures a mock cannot have, because a mock has no process
 * to outlive the kill.
 *
 * The commands are deliberately chosen for what they prove: one that prints and
 * exits (a session that finishes on its own), one that waits for input (a session
 * that stays `running` so `kill` has something to kill), and one that prints more
 * than the read cap (so truncation is observable rather than assumed).
