/**
 * The wire format of the PTY sidecar.
 *
 * Frames are length-prefixed, never line-delimited:
 *
 * ```text
 * +--------+------------------+-------------------+
 * | 1 byte | 4 bytes LE u32   | N bytes           |
 * | type   | payload length   | payload           |
 * +--------+------------------+-------------------+
 * ```
 *
 * This exists because a terminal produces bytes that a string cannot carry
 * faithfully: ANSI escape sequences, NUL, and multi-byte characters split across
 * a read boundary. A frame carries raw bytes, so nothing on the hot path is ever
 * decoded and re-encoded, and the one thing that would corrupt output — passing
 * terminal bytes through a text encoding — cannot happen.
 *
 * Both directions are declared here rather than in the adapter, because the
 * frame layout is a contract between two programs: if the type numbers drift,
 * the sidecar will read a write as a kill and report success.
