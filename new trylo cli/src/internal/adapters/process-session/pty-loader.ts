/**
 * Finding the PTY sidecar at runtime.
 *
 * # Why this is careful
 *
 * Three ways this can go wrong, and what each one costs:
 *
 *  - **Not finding it** — a user asks for a terminal session and gets nothing.
 *    Better than a wrong answer, so the failure names the platform and the
 *    build command.
 *  - **Finding a stale copy** — a helper from a different build, which reads
 *    frames this build does not understand and produces a session that looks
 *    alive and reports nothing.
 *  - **Needing the source tree** — working in the repo and broken after
 *    `npm pack`. A tool that only runs for its author is not a tool.
 *
 * So the resolution is: relative to this module's own compiled location, which
 * `copy-pty-vendor.mjs` writes to, with the platform/arch as part of the path so
 * a wrong-architecture copy cannot be found at all. `TRYLO_PTY_HELPER` exists
 * for development and diagnostics, and is *verified* rather than trusted — an
 * override that points at the wrong thing fails instead of quietly working.

 * Node's platform name is not the directory name.

 * the substitution has to happen after the default is applied. Written as one
 * expression it is easy to test the wrong side of the ternary — `undefined ===
 * "win32"` is false, which yields `win32` and a path that does not exist. That
 * bug shipped once in this file and produced a suite that skipped itself with a
 * perfectly readable message and no failing test, so the substitution is a named
 * function and `pty-loader.test.ts` pins it.
