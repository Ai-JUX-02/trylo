/**
 * Killing a pid this process did not spawn (WP26 / A04: `trylo bg kill` from a
 * second terminal).
 *
 * Two facts, pinned separately because they have opposite remedies:
 *
 * - win32 reuses the same `taskkill /T /F` walk the in-process path uses, naming
 *   the pid — one implementation, so one cannot drift from the other.
 * - POSIX refuses outright with `tree_kill_unsupported_platform` and launches no
 *   helper. A group signal (`-pid`) is only safe against a group leader; a pid
 *   read off disk may not be one, and signalling this process's own group would
 *   kill unrelated work. Unimplemented on purpose, and loud about it.
 *
 * Everything here drives the injection seam — no process is ever killed.
