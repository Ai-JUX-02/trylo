/**
 * The decision layer of tree termination, tested without killing anything real.
 *
 * What is being pinned is the part that is easy to get quietly wrong: a walk
 * that fails must be *reported*, a platform with no walk must not pretend to
 * have one, and stopping something already stopped must stay a success. The
 * real-machine behaviour lives in `process-tree.platform.test.ts` — these cases
 * exist so a failure there is unambiguous rather than a mystery.
