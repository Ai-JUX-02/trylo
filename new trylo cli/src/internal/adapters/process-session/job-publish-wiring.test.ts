/**
 * The registry publishes into the durable table, so `trylo bg` from a second
 * process sees what this process started.
 *
 * This is the seam the whole feature depends on, and it is the kind of seam that
 * has bitten this package twice: every piece on either side of it can be tested
 * alone and stay green while nothing connects them (the daemon's launch target,
 * the family entry point nobody called). So this file does not test the store or
 * the registry — it tests that a real child process, started through the real
 * registry, ends up readable through the store, with its output and with an exit
 * code written by the only process that could see it.
