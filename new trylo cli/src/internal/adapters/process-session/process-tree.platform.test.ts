/**
 * The real thing: does the tree actually go away on this machine?
 *
 * Everything else about this module can be asserted with a fake child. This file
 * exists because the point of C13 is a *machine* fact — a descendant that
 * outlives a direct-child kill — and only a real process tree shows it.
 *
 * # The shape matters, and it was measured rather than assumed
 *
 * The direct child is `cmd.exe`, because that is what `run_shell` actually
 * spawns (`shell-spawn.ts` → `spawn(cmd.exe, ["/c", ...])`). A first attempt used
 * `node` as the direct child and the grandchild died with it, which would have
 * made this file assert a defect production does not have.
 * `evidence/2026-10-05-WP07/04-tree-shape-comparison.log` measures both:
 *
 *   node-parent: grandchild alive after a direct kill = false   ← not production
 *   cmd-parent:  grandchild alive after a direct kill = true    ← production shape
 *
 * So the baseline is recorded as a *diagnostic* and never as an assertion that
 * the defect exists — a future Windows release may close it, and this file must
 * not fail when it does.
 *
 * # Every process this file starts, it stops
 *
 * The first version leaked. A surviving descendant inherits the stdout pipe, so
 * the node test runner's event loop never drained and the file died on the suite
 * timeout with three green tests and a red file. Each helper below therefore
 * reports the *middle* process too, and `finally` ends whatever is left — a test
 * that leaves processes behind also stalls whoever runs the suite next.
