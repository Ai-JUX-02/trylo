 * The third test exists because of a real bug. The platform label was written as
 * one expression that tested the *argument* rather than the resolved value, so
 * an absent argument produced `win32-x64` instead of `win-x64`. Nothing failed:
 * the PTY suite skipped itself with a readable message, the build stayed green,
 * and a machine with a perfectly good terminal helper reported that it had none.
 *
 * The first version of this file tested `ptyPlatformArch` directly and its red
 * example did not turn red — the resolver had its own inline expression, so
 * pinning the function said nothing about the code that runs. The test below
 * goes through `resolvePtyHelper` and inspects the directory it decided on.
