/**
 * The environment a child process is allowed to see.
 *
 * This is a *base*, not a filter applied afterwards: an entry can add keys
 * (with `env` in the registry) but nothing here lets one reach the parent's
 * full environment. A credential that lives in Trylo's own process therefore
 * cannot leak into an MCP server merely because Trylo happened to start it.
 *
 * It lives apart from the transport so the whitelist can be read — and tested —
 * without a spawned process in sight.
