/**
 * The resident scheduler loop (WP26 / A04 host for A06).
 *
 * ## What it does, once per tick
 *
 * ```text
 * take the schedule lease (once, at start)
 *   ↓
 * for each tick:
 *   claim due occurrences  →  run each  →  settle each  →  heartbeat
 * ```
 *
 * The lease is taken **once** and held, not re-taken per tick. Taking it per tick
 * would mean two daemons alternate rather than one owning the schedule, and the
 * window between "released" and "taken" is exactly where a duplicate fire lives.
 *
 * ## The limits, because ADR §5 requires them
 *
 * Every unbounded thing here is bounded, and the bounds are named:
 *
 *  - **One in-flight tick.** A tick that overruns does not start a second one. An
 *    unbounded loop of timers would let a slow run queue work faster than it
 *    completes, and the backlog would be invisible.
 *  - **A tick budget per pass.** `maxOccurrencesPerTick` caps how much one pass
 *    takes, so a machine waking after a long sleep fires a bounded burst rather
 *    than every missed slot at once.
 *  - **An idle ceiling.** A `sleep` that returns without waiting — a timer that
 *    never fires, an injected stub, a clock that jumps — would turn the loop into
 *    a tight cycle doing filesystem IO forever. The loop counts consecutive ticks
 *    that completed in under one interval and stops itself rather than spinning.
 *    This bound was added because a test that injected an immediate `sleep` hung
 *    the process, which is the cheapest possible demonstration of the defect.
 *  - **A daemon tick interval**, and a heartbeat that reports how many intervals
 *    behind it is, so "running" is falsifiable.
 *  - **A shutdown path** that gives in-flight work a moment to settle before the
 *    process leaves. `force` skips it, and says so.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not own
 *
 * It does not own the session, the provider, or the queue. Firing hands the prompt
 * to the *existing* per-session queue and returns; the session runs the turn when
 * it goes idle. A daemon with its own runner would be a second execution path
 * with its own idea of which session is current.

   * A watch and a cron schedule are rows of **one** file. A step that got its own

   * passes in one tick is exactly how a row goes missing: the second write is

   * settled occurrences, and rewrite the row list — and nothing else. It cannot
   * take the lease, cannot claim occurrences, and cannot settle one, because those
   * stay here. That is what makes "one writer per tick" a structural property
