/**
 * The platform answer to "when did this pid start" (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * ## What each platform can actually do
 *
 * Measured on this host (win32, Node v22.22.2 —
 * `evidence/2026-10-07-WP26-review/process-identity.out.txt`):
 *
 *  - **win32**: `Win32_Process.CreationDate` via PowerShell. Verified to work,
 *    ~200–600 ms per call. `wmic` does not work on this host, so it is not a
 *    fallback.
 *  - **darwin/linux**: `ps -o lstart= -p <pid>` gives a start time. Not exercised
 *    on this machine — see the caveat below.
 *
 * ## The honesty rule, and why POSIX is *not* implemented here
 *
 * A probe that cannot answer must throw, not return a plausible number. The win32
 * implementation is therefore the only one, and {@link createProcessIdentityProbe}
 * throws for POSIX with a message naming what is missing.
 *
 * That looks like leaving POSIX unsupported, and it is a deliberate choice: the
 * alternative is writing `ps -o lstart=` **without having run it**, and the
 * timestamp formats differ (BSD `lstart` is a fixed layout, GNU `lstart` is
 * locale-dependent, and a container's `ps` may not support `-o lstart` at all).
 * A wrong start time is worse than no start time, because `identityMatches` would
 * then reject a live daemon as a stranger — turning a missing feature into a
 * broken one. POSIX is recorded as unverified platform work, not silently
 * approximated.
 *
 * ## Why the probe is a seam and not an import
 *
 * The domain module must not spawn PowerShell. Injecting the probe keeps the
 * decision ("is this still my daemon?") pure and testable without a process
 * table, and gives a platform that can read start times another way in.
