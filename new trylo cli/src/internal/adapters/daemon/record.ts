/**
 * Where the daemon advertises itself, and what it says when it is asked
 * (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * ## Two files, because they answer different questions
 *
 * - `daemon.json` — **discovery**: pid plus start time. Written once at spawn,
 *   read by every `trylo daemon status`. It is tiny on purpose, because it is read
 *   often and it must be readable even when the daemon is in trouble.
 * - `state.json` — **heartbeat**: last tick and fire count. Written every tick.
 *
 * They are separate because they have opposite failure modes. Discovery must
 * survive a daemon that cannot write its own heartbeat — a daemon wedged in a
 * tick still needs to be *findable* so somebody can stop it. And the heartbeat
 * must never be mistaken for proof of life: a file saying "last tick at T" is
 * evidence about the past, while the identity pair is evidence about now.
 *
 * ## Atomicity, inherited
 *
 * `writeThrough` is the same temporary-file-plus-rename the queue store uses. A
 * reader that catches a half-written heartbeat would otherwise read a truncated
 * JSON and conclude "the daemon is gone" — which is exactly the wrong conclusion
 * during the moment the daemon is busiest.

 * process keeps running until it is killed — see
 * `evidence/2026-10-07-WP26-review/daemon-entry-e2e.out.txt`, where the daemon
 * advertises itself, fires its schedule, ignores `SIGTERM`, and leaves its
 * discovery record behind. The old CLI has the same shape
 * (`bridge/bridgeMain.ts:2660`), so this is a platform fact rather than a bug
 * somebody introduced.
 *
 * A file is used instead because it works the same on both platforms and needs no
 * channel to be open. The cost is a stat per tick, which is the same order as the
 * heartbeat write the loop already does.
