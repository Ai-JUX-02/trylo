 * The resident scheduler loop (WP26 / A04 host for A06).

 * The claims under test are the ones ADR §5 makes load-bearing: a bounded tick, a
 * bounded burst, one owner, and a stop that actually ends the loop. Each is checked
 * through observable effects — files on disk, the runner's own record of what it was
 * asked to do — rather than by asserting a method was called.
 *
 * The clock and the sleep are injected, so "the daemon kept ticking" is a fact
