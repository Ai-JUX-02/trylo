/**
 * Starting, finding and stopping the scheduler daemon (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * ## The spawn flags, and why they are the opposite of a command's
 *
 * A tool command is spawned **so it dies with the session** —
 * `adapters/tools/mutating/shell-spawn.ts` deliberately leaves `detached` off on
 * win32 and sets it on POSIX so the tree stays reachable for `terminateProcessTree`.
 * A daemon is the other requirement: it has to **outlive** the terminal that
 * started it, or a background schedule would end when the person closes the
 * window that created it.
 *
 * Measured on this host (`evidence/2026-10-07-WP26-review/detach-facts.out.txt`,
 * win32 / Node v22.22.2):
 *
 *  - `detached: true` + `windowsHide: true` + `stdio: "ignore"` ⇒ the child
 *    **survived** its spawning process's exit (`afterParentExit: true`).
 *  - The same spawn without `detached` ⇒ the child never even got far enough to
 *    announce itself, because the parent exited immediately.
 *
 * `windowsHide` matters on its own account: without it, win32's `detached` maps to
 * `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`, so a background daemon would open a console window. That
 * is a visible interruption of whatever the person is doing, and the whole point
 * of this process is that they never have to think about it.
 *
 * `stdio` is **not** `"ignore"`, and that is a recent correction. Ignoring the
 * streams is the right shape for "do not keep the terminal's pipes open" and the
 * wrong shape for "the child died before it advertised": the reason went nowhere,
 * so `start` could only ever report a pid for a process that had already failed —
 * which is exactly what happened when the launch target was wrong. stdout and
 * stderr now go to `daemon/daemon.log`, and a failed launch quotes the tail of it.
 * The daemon still must not hold the terminal open, so stdin stays ignored.
 *
 * ## `start` waits for the daemon to say it is here
 *
 * It used to answer "spawned" and leave the question of liveness to `status`, on
 * the reasoning that this process cannot observe the child's success. That
 * reasoning was wrong in a way a person pays for: `trylo daemon start` returned 0
 * while nothing was running. Every implementation surveyed resolves this — codex
 * opens the pid and checks it right after spawning (`pid_start.rs`), goose races
 * an exit flag against a readiness poll, opencode health-checks before trusting a
 * registration. So `start` waits until the child has written its discovery record
 * with **its own pid**, or until it dies, or until the bound runs out. No timer
 * is used to decide *whether* the daemon failed (that is the trap of "if it exits
 * within N ms it failed"); the bound only decides when to stop waiting, and the
 * exit event short-circuits it.
 *
 * ## Why `stop` asks rather than kills, by default
 *
 * A graceful stop lets the current tick settle before the process leaves. The
 * force path exists because a wedged daemon will not respond to anything, and a
 * person who cannot stop it has no way to start a new one. Both are explicit:
 * `force` is a separate flag, not a mode argument that could be passed by mistake.
