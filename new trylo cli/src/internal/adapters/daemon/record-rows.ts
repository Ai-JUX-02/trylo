/**
 * Replacing the watch rows in the shared record (WP26 / A06 + A07).
 *
 * ## What this file exists to make safe
 *
 * The scheduler's record holds two kinds of thing in one `schedules` array: cron
 * rows and watch rows, plus a separate `occurrences` array saying what has already
 * been settled. A writer that rebuilt the file from the rows it was handed would
 * delete every settled occurrence — and those occurrences are precisely the
 * record that makes a repeated fire detectable after a restart. Losing them
 * silently re-enables the duplicate notification the whole design exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * So the shape here is deliberately narrow: **watch rows in, nothing else
 * touched.** The cron rows and the occurrences come from the file, not from the
 * caller. A caller cannot accidentally rewrite a schedule it does not understand,
 * because it has no way to pass one.
 *
 * ## Why it is not atomic against another process
 *
 * It is a read-modify-write followed by a rename. The rename is atomic, so no
 * reader ever sees half a file — but a second process writing between the read
 * and the rename would still lose this one's change. That is not defended here
 * because it is defended one level up: every call happens inside a tick that
 * already holds the scheduler lease, and the lease is why there is one writer per
 * host. This function's job is to not be a second writer.
