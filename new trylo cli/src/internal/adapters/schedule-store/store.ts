/**
 * The file-backed schedule store (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * ## One writer, and what happens when there are two
 *
 * Every mutating verb requires the lease token. A caller holding a stale token
 * gets `lease_lost` and must stop — not retry. That is the fencing rule: the new
 * owner may already have claimed the occurrence this one is about to write, so
 * a stale writer that retries is not behind, it is racing.
 *
 * ## The crash windows, and what each one leaves behind
 *
 * There are exactly two, and both are recoverable because the occurrence id is
 * derived rather than generated:
 *
 *  - Crash after `claimDue` wrote, before the runner was handed the occurrence.
 *    The record says `claimed` with an attempt id. Nothing ran, so recovery may
 *    re-dispatch it — the attempt id changes and the earlier claim is visible.
 *  - Crash after the effect landed, before `settle`. The record still says
 *    `claimed` or `dispatched`. Recovery **cannot** tell whether the effect
 *    happened, so it marks the occurrence `unknown` and hands it to
 *    reconciliation. It does not retry: an unattended job whose result nobody
 *    observed is exactly where a blind retry does the work twice.
 *
 * ## Why the recurrence anchor is written on settle, not on claim
 *
 * `lastFiredAtMs` moves only when an occurrence settles. Moving it at claim time
 * would lose the fire if the process died between claim and run, and the
 * occurrence would silently never happen; moving it after settle is what makes
 * "fired" mean "ran and was recorded".
