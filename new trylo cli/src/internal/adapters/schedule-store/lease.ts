/**
 * The single-writer lease for the scheduler (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * ## Why a lease and not a lock file
 *
 * The reused source (`utils/cronTasksLock.ts`) used `O_EXCL` plus a PID
 * liveness probe: if the lock's PID was gone, unlink it and take the lock. That
 * recovers from a crash, and it also steals the lock from a holder that is
 * **slow** — and the holder here is another `trylo` writing a person's
 * scheduled work. Worse, PID liveness is not identity: PIDs are reused, so a
 * live-but-unrelated process can keep a dead scheduler's lock alive, and a dead
 * one can be mistaken for the owner.
 *
 * So the lease carries three things instead:
 *
 *  - an **owner id**, chosen by the caller, so "who" is answerable without
 *    guessing from a pid;
 *  - an opaque **token**, which every write must present, so a process that lost
 *    the lease cannot keep writing — the fencing property, and the thing that
 *    makes a stale holder harmless rather than merely discouraged;
 *  - the pid, written for a human staring at a stuck scheduler and read back by
 *    nobody for a decision.
 *
 * A token is compared, never guessed. This is the same refusal the queue lock
 * already makes (`adapters/queue-store/queue-writer.ts`): a lock left by an
 * unknown holder is `not_owner`, not something to take over. Recovery from a
 * genuinely dead owner is the *host's* decision — it can see that the daemon is
 * gone — and this file only ever hands out the facts needed to make it.
