/**
 * The durable schedule record, and the codec that guards it (WP26 / A06).
 *
 * ## What is stored, and why the file has two halves
 *
 * `{ schedules, occurrences }` in one file, written whole. Occurrences are kept
 * rather than re-derived on every read because a *settled* occurrence is a fact
 * about something that already happened: re-deriving "did that run" from the
 * cron and the clock would make the answer depend on when it is asked, and a
 * crashed run would look identical to a pending one.
 *
 * One file rather than two because the two halves must move together. A
 * schedule tombstoned in one file and its in-flight occurrence in another is a
 * state where the delete looks complete and the work still runs.
 *
 * ## Durability, inherited rather than reinvented
 *
 * `rewriteAll` (`adapters/queue-store/queue-file.ts`) already provides the two
 * properties this file needs: a write is fsynced before it is acknowledged, and
 * a rewrite goes through a temporary file and a rename so a reader never sees a
 * half-written record. Copying that logic here would be a second implementation
 * of the one guarantee that decides whether a crash loses a person's schedule.
 *
 * ## Reading is validated, never cast
 *
 * A hand-edited or truncated file is read field by field and a row that does not
 * typecheck is dropped with its index reported. A blind cast would turn one bad
 * row into a `Schedule` whose `cron` is `undefined`, and the failure would
 * surface much later as a scheduler that silently stops firing.
 *
 * Tombstoned rows are **kept**, not filtered on read. They are what stops a
 * crash between "tombstone" and "prune" from resurrecting deleted work.
