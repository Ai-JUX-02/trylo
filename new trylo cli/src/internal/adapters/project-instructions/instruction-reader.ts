/**
 * Reading a project's own engineering instructions.
 *
 * A repository that states its build command, its conventions and its untouchable
 * files has written them down; a coding agent that does not read that file makes
 * the user say it again in every session. This module is the one place that
 * turns those files into messages, and it is deliberately an *adapter*: it is the
 * only code here that knows `AGENTS.md` exists, that touches the disk, or that
 * hashes anything. The loop receives finished messages and stays ignorant of all
 * three (WP-CLI-B1 §3.2).
 *
 * What this is not: it is not a learning asset, not a Profile rule, and not a
 * Board product. `contract/context.ts::composeMessages` labels Profile content as
 * learned historical hints, and an engineering rule wearing that label would be
 * a lie about where it came from — and would change meaning the moment someone
 * turned the learning switch off. These messages are assembled by the CLI host
 * and enter the request through the generic caller-messages seam, so they are
 * present whether or not any learning subsystem exists.

 * instructions contradict each other with nothing to say which wins.
