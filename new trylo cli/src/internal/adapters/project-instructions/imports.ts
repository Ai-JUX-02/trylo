/**
 * `@path` imports in project instruction files (WP14 / L50, 复核 F3/F4).
 *
 * The old CLI's CLAUDE.md import grammar, narrowed to what can be bounded:
 *
 *  - a reference is honoured only when it sits **alone on a line** —
 *    `@./rules.md` — never inline, so a code sample can never pull a file into
 *    every request;
 *  - **every resolved import must stay inside the workspace.** The files being
 *    expanded come from the workspace's own rule chain, so an import that
 *    reaches outside it (`@~/…`, `@/etc/…`) is a project document asking the
 *    host to paste private bytes into the model request — that is refused and
 *    reported, not performed (复核 F3: the earlier draft allowed home imports
 *    and carried a dead `workspaceRoot` parameter; both are gone);
 *  - expansion is depth-limited, cycle-guarded and budget-capped in **bytes**,
 *    with the budget shared across the whole expansion (one tree, one budget —
 *    a nested chain cannot spend a fresh copy of it per branch). Every limit
 *    it hits is reported as a problem, never trimmed silently.
