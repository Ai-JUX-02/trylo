/**
 * Incremental Server-Sent Events parsing, for the two remote MCP transports.
 *
 * Streamable HTTP may answer a POST with an `text/event-stream` body, and the
 * legacy `sse` transport is one long-lived event stream, so both need the same
 * reader. The parser is a pure state machine — text in, events out, state
 * carried over — exactly like `scanFrames` in `mcp/jsonrpc.ts`, for the same
 * reason: every hostile shape (a split event, a comment, a multi-line data
 * field, a missing event name) is a unit test that needs no socket.
 *
 * The carried state matters: an event whose terminator lands in a later chunk
 * must survive the call boundary, or a perfectly legal stream is silently
 * truncated at a TCP segment line. That is what {@link SseOpenState} is for —
 * callers thread it back in on the next call.
 *
 * Only what the MCP wire uses is honored: `event`, `data` and comments.
 * `id`/`retry` and unknown fields are accepted and ignored — this client does
 * not reconnect, so a last-event id has nothing to resume from.
