 * A fake would prove the arithmetic and nothing else. Three of the properties
 * this port exists for are only visible on disk: that an append survives the
 * process that wrote it, that a torn line is refused instead of skipped, and
 * that a second *process* is turned away rather than allowed to write at the
 * same time. The last one cannot be shown in-process at all — two callers in one
 * process share a lock object, and a lock object proves nothing about a file.
