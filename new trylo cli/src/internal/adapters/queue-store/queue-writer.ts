/**
 * One writer per queue file, across processes.
 *
 * Codex's queue service wraps every mutation in a per-thread mutex and calls the
 * result a queue model. That is enough for two coroutines in one process and
 * not enough for two `trylo` processes, which is the entire point of a
 * *background* queue: `trylo queue --message ...` in one terminal while the
 * session it belongs to runs in another. The lock therefore lives in the
 * filesystem, next to the file it protects, and is taken by creating a file that
 * must not already exist (`O_CREAT | O_EXCL`).
 *
 * The alternatives were rejected on evidence rather than taste:
 *
 *  - **Advisory locking** (`flock`/`LockFileEx`) has no portable Node API, so it
 *    would mean a native dependency for a P2 capability.
 *  - **A timestamp-and-steal lock** recovers from a crashed holder, but it also
 *    steals the lock from a *slow* holder — and the holder here is another agent
 *    writing a person's words. Preferring liveness over safety here would trade
 *    a lost message for a lost message.
 *
 * So a lock left behind by a dead process is a *refusal*, not something to guess
 * about, exactly as the permission ledger already does it
 * (`adapters/permission-store/lock.ts`): `queue_locked` says "someone else is
 * writing", and the person can see that and retry. What this file must never do
 * is decide the lock is stale and take it — that is the one behaviour that turns
 * a denial of service into silent corruption.
