/**
 * How one registry file is locked, read and replaced.
 *
 * The storage rules exist because this is a *document*, not an event log:
 *
 *  - **Whole-file replace.** Appending to a document makes "the file has two
 *    `formatVersion` keys" representable, and there is no reason to allow it.
 *  - **Rename, not truncate.** The new bytes are written to a sibling temporary
 *    file and renamed into place, so a reader sees the old document or the new
 *    one, never a half-written one. A crash leaves an abandoned temp file at
 *    worst.
 *  - **One writer.** A lock file beside the document is created with `wx`, so
 *    the second writer is refused rather than interleaving. The lock is not
 *    stolen when stale: only the process that took it releases it, because
 *    guessing that a lock is stale is how two writers end up believing they
 *    both own the file.
 *  - **Fail closed on read.** A document that cannot be decoded raises the
 *    error. It is never collapsed into "no servers", which would make the next
 *    write destroy whatever the file really contained.
