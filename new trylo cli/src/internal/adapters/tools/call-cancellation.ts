/**
 * Reaching a tool call that is already running.
 *
 * # The gap this closes
 *
 * `ToolPort.cancel(toolCallId)` existed and every mutating tool answered it with
 * an empty body — `mutating/index.ts` claimed a shell "holds nothing after its
 * timeout fires". That was true of the *result* and false of the *process*: the
 * loop dispatches `cancel_tool` when a turn is cancelled, so a user pressing
 * Ctrl-C during a long build produced a `cancel_tool` effect that cancelled
 * nothing. The turn ended `cancelled` while the build kept running, which is
 * exactly the defect the parity table names as "UI stopping is not the tool
 * stopping".
 *
 * # Why this does not fight the loop
 *
 * The loop deliberately does **not** cut a running tool's own signal: a write in
 * flight must be allowed to finish atomically (`cancel.ts` says so, and
 * `cancel-signal.test.ts` pins it). This registry is the second channel. It does
 * not touch `engine.abort`; it gives a tool an *extra* reason to stop, which the
 * tool may accept or decline. `write_file` and friends decline — they hold
 * nothing to stop. `run_shell` accepts, because it owns a process tree.
 *
 * So the ordering guarantee the loop cares about survives untouched: a cancel is
 * still applied as a state transition at a boundary, never thrown into a write.

 * the explicit "this call, now". They arrive at different moments, and a tool
 * watching only one would keep running when the other fired.
 *
 * The listener is removed on release so a settled call leaves nothing attached
 * to the turn's signal — otherwise every command would add a listener to a
 * signal that lives as long as the turn.
