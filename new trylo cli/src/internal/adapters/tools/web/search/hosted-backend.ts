/**
 * Web search over a provider's **hosted** search tool (WP20.1: C58 / L21).
 *
 * Reuse, and what was deliberately not reused:
 *
 *  - Codex `codex-rs/ext/web-search/src/tool.rs` + `codex-api/src/endpoint/search.rs`
 *    give the shape: a POST of a typed request to a provider search endpoint,
 *    answered with an output plus a list of results. That endpoint is
 *    `alpha/search`, and it is **not** reused — not for want of a credential
 *    (it takes a generic `SharedAuthProvider`, and Codex's own integration test
 *    drives it with a plain `Bearer test-api-key`), but because its answers are
 *    deliberately untyped: `codex-api/src/search.rs:298-305` declares
 *    `results: Option<Vec<JsonValue>>` and comments that it stays opaque there
 *    so newer variants remain forward-compatible. Reading it would mean
 *    guessing a structure, and this package's whole rule is that a source is
 *    either read off the wire or refused;
 *  - what is reused is the decision that search is a *hosted provider
 *    capability* rather than something a client should implement, and the
 *    distinction Codex draws between a cached and a live search (`WebSearchMode`)
 *    — cached may be answered from an index, live must reach the network;
 *  - the Responses hosted-tool name (`web_search`) and its citation shape come
 *    from OpenAI's documented wire, verified against the Responses guide rather
 *    than inferred from Codex's ChatGPT-only path.
 *
 * What makes this honest rather than a search that always answers:
 *
 *  - **no endpoint, no search.** `createHostedSearchBackend` returns `undefined`
 *    without an endpoint, and the tool is then not mounted. There is no code
 *    path in which a `web_search` binding exists with nothing behind it;
 *  - **sources are extracted from the wire, never composed.** A citation is a
 *    `url_citation` annotation with a URL. Text without annotations yields
 *    `empty_result`, not a result with an invented source;
 *  - **the answer is the provider's.** This tool does not paraphrase, does not
 *    summarise, and does not add a sentence of its own to the model's output.
 *    Anything it added would be a claim with no citation behind it;
 *  - **`live` is not silently downgraded.** A caller who asked for live search
 *    and got a cached answer has been told something false about the freshness
 *    of what they are reading, so the mode travels on the wire as the provider's
 *    own `external_web_access` flag.
