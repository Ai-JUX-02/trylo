/**
 * `web_search`: a tool whose entire value is that it does not lie.
 *
 * The binding is `external` and needs approval for the same reason `web_fetch`
 * is — a search reaches the network and can cost money. But the approval gate is
 * not what makes this tool trustworthy. What makes it trustworthy is that it has
 * exactly three possible answers, and two of them are refusals:
 *
 *  - a real answer, carrying the URLs it is based on, in `output` **and** in
 *    `value.sources` so a later turn can check them without re-reading prose;
 *  - `unavailable`, when this provider cannot search at all;
 *  - the backend's own typed refusal (`auth`, `rate_limit`, `network`,
 *    `empty_result`), passed through rather than flattened.
 *
 * There is no fourth path. In particular this module never composes a result
 * from an error, never retries with a different query to make a failure go away,
 * and never returns text without the sources that text came from. A search tool
 * that answers when it cannot search is worse than no search tool, because the
 * model cannot tell the difference between a citation and a recollection.
 *
 * The `sources` list is rendered into the model-facing text as markdown links
 * rather than left implicit, matching the legacy tool's closing reminder that the
 * sources must actually be cited — an unrendered citation is a citation the model
 * never sees.
