/**
 * The admission plan for one `web_fetch` call, asked by the tool immediately
 * before it touches the network. Sandbox admission for this tool is
 * mount-scoped (`--allow-web` puts the name on the composite's admit set, the
 * MCP pattern); this plan is what keeps the *target* honest even after the
 * human has approved the call.
 *
 * The constraint is the URL, not the workspace: an http(s) absolute URL and
 * nothing else. `file:`, `data:`, bare words and empty strings all fail here,
 * which is what keeps the tool from being a filesystem escape dressed up as a
 * network call.
 *
 * `prompt` is planned, not executed: it is the caller's question about the page,
 * and whether this run can answer it at all is decided by whether an extractor
 * was lent (see `extract-prompt.ts`). Planning it here means a `prompt` on a run
 * with no extractor is refused before the fetch, instead of after — a page
 * fetched, paid for, and then discarded.
