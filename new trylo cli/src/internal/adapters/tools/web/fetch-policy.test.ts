/**
 * Redirect permission and cache admission, both without a socket.
 *
 * These are the two decisions that decide whether a fetch is *allowed* and whether
 * it has to happen at all, so they are tested as pure functions: every case here
 * is a case a server would have to be stood up for otherwise, and a test that
 * needs a server cannot distinguish "the policy refused" from "the server was
 * slow".
 *
 * The cases that matter most are the ones a permissive implementation gets wrong:
 * a cross-host hop, a protocol change, credentials in the target, a relative
 * `Location` that turns absolute, and a redirect loop.
