/**
 * Running one planned `web_fetch` to a tool outcome.
 *
 * Separate from `index.ts` because this is a five-step pipeline — cache, socket,
 * cap, prose, extraction — and folding it into the module that also declares the
 * bindings made both harder to read than either would be alone. The split is by
 * decision, not by line count: `index.ts` answers "which tool is this and is it
 * mounted", this file answers "what happened to this URL".
 *
 * The order of the steps is the contract. Redirects are resolved before the body
 * is touched, the cap is enforced while reading rather than after, and the prose
 * is built before extraction so the extractor's input is the same text the model
 * would have read.
