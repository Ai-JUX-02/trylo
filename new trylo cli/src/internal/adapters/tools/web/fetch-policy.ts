/**
 * Where a `web_fetch` may be sent, and when it may not be sent again.
 *
 * Both halves of this file are pure on purpose. Redirect permission is a
 * decision about two URLs, and cache admission is a decision about one URL and
 * a clock; neither needs a socket, so neither can be tested by standing up a
 * server. The socket work happens in `fetch-body.ts` and only after these have
 * said yes.
 *
 * Reuse: legacy `WebFetchTool/utils.ts:isPermittedRedirect` (same scheme, same
 * port, same host modulo a `www.` prefix) and its `MAX_REDIRECTS = 10` hop cap,
 * which exists because a server answering `/a → /b → /a` resets the per-request
 * timeout on every hop and hangs until the user interrupts. The legacy
 * `URL_CACHE` (15-minute TTL, 50 MB) becomes `FetchCache` here with the clock
 * injected, because a cache whose expiry depends on a wall clock read at the
 * call site cannot be tested at all.

 * redirect that changes any of those is not followed — it is *reported*, so the
 * model can decide whether to ask for the new URL explicitly and put it in
 * front of a human. Following it silently is how an approved fetch to one host
 * becomes a fetch to another.
