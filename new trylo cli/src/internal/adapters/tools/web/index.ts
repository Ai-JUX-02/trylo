/**
 * The network tools this package ships, and the story of their safety told by
 * which gate each one stands behind.
 *
 * The sandbox does not block networks — `network=restricted` only strips proxy
 * variables from children, and `run_shell` could always open a socket. The real
 * containment is *declaration*: an `external` side effect plus `needsApproval`,
 * which means a named human (or a named `--allow-tools`) lets each call through,
 * and a non-interactive run that asked for nothing gets nothing. Nothing is
 * mounted at all unless `--allow-web` was typed, so a default run never sees a
 * network tool and its catalog hash never moves.
 *
 * `web_search` adds a second absence on top of that one, and the second is not
 * redundant. Approval answers "may this call go out?"; it cannot answer "does
 * anything exist that could answer it?". A search binding with no backend would
 * pass every approval and then fail on use, so the search tool is mounted only
 * when a `WebSearchPort` was lent. Three states stay three states: flag off
 * (neither tool), flag on without a backend (`web_fetch` only), flag on with one
 * (both).
 *
 * `web_fetch`'s own promises are in `fetch-runner.ts`, which owns the five steps
 * from cache to prose. What lives here is the part that has to be true before
 * any of them run: which tools exist, whether `prompt` can be honoured at all,
 * and that a foreign name is answered rather than ignored.
