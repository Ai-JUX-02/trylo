/**
 * Turning a fetched page into the part of it the caller asked for.
 *
 * Reuse: legacy `WebFetchTool/utils.ts:applyPromptToMarkdown` — fetch, then hand
 * the page to a small model with the caller's question, so the model receives an
 * answer instead of 100 KB of navigation chrome. Two things are deliberately
 * *not* reused: the legacy tool calls Haiku directly, and it caps the page at a
 * literal 100 000 characters before sending.
 *
 * The provider is a seam here. This tool has no idea which model answers, does
 * not hold a credential, and must not grow a second way of reaching one — the
 * caller that already resolved a provider lends a closure, and a run with no
 * provider for this purpose gets no `prompt` argument in its schema rather than a
 * schema that fails at call time.
 *
 * The `unavailable` refusal is the load-bearing part. A page the tool cannot
 * summarise must reach the model as the page, not as an apology: the model can
 * read prose, it cannot read "summarisation was unavailable".
