/**
 * HTML → text without a parser, on purpose.
 *
 * A real DOM parser would be a dependency, and the contract this serves is
 * small: the model needs the *prose* of a page, not its layout. So the rules
 * are the three that matter and no others —
 *
 *  - `script` and `style` blocks vanish whole, because their text is code and
 *    a model repeating `alert('x')` back is noise at best;
 *  - every remaining tag becomes whitespace, so words glued between `<p>`
 *    boundaries stay separated;
 *  - the six entities that actually appear in prose are decoded; anything else
 *    (`&copy;`, numeric references) is left visibly as written, because a half
 *    -decoded page is worse than an honestly marked one.
