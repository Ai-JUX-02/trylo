/**
 * Finding a file when you only half-remember its name.
 *
 * The gap this fills: `glob_files` needs an exact pattern and `search_text` needs
 * exact content, so both fail the ordinary human move of typing three letters of
 * a filename. That is not a rare case — it is how people actually address files.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately is not:
 *
 *   - **Not a content search.** A filename match says nothing about what is
 *     inside the file. Reporting it as though it did is how a model ends up
 *     citing a file it never read, so the two live in separate tools with
 *     separate contracts and separate answers.
 *   - **Not a second walker.** Enumeration, `.gitignore`, default exclusions and
 *     the depth/file ceilings all come from `read-only/walk.ts`, the same code
 *     `search_text` uses. A file that `search_text` cannot see is a file this
 *     cannot suggest; two traversals with two notions of "in the project" is how
 *     those notions drift apart.
 *
 * The index is built once per workspace and reused. Rebuilding per keystroke is
 * what makes a fuzzy finder feel slow, and the whole point of the feature is that
 * it feels immediate.
