/**
 * Does a cancel actually stop a running command?
 *
 * This is the C04 question and it is worth a real process. Before this, the
 * mutating tools implemented `ToolPort.cancel` with an empty body, so the
 * `cancel_tool` effect the loop dispatches on a cancelled turn reached nothing:
 * the turn ended `cancelled`, the UI said so, and the command kept running. That
 * is the "UI stopping is not the tool stopping" defect.
 *
 * These go through `createWorkspaceTools` — the object the CLI actually builds —
 * rather than a registry wired by hand, because a test that reached past the
 * production wiring would pass against exactly the code that was unreachable.
