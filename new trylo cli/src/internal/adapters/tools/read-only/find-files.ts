/**
 * `find_files`: approximate file name, workspace-relative paths out.
 *
 * Split from `index.ts` for the same reason `read-file.ts` was: the dispatcher
 * decides *what happens*, this file decides *what the answer says*. The two
 * answers this tool can give are the whole design:
 *
 *   - `matches: [...]` — the index was complete and here is what it found;
 *   - `indexIncomplete: true` — the index hit a ceiling, so **an empty list means
 *     "not found in what we could see"**, not "this project has no such file".
 *
 * Collapsing those two into one empty array is the specific dishonesty this
 * contract exists to prevent: a model told "no such file" will tell the user the
 * file does not exist, and it will be wrong because the walk stopped early.
