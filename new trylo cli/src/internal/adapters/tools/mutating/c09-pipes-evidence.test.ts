/**
 * WP05.2, the data half: what a command's words and its bytes actually become.
 *
 * The composition suite proves the SHAPE of what reaches the spawner with a
 * recording double. This file is the other half for the same path with
 * `createNodeSpawner`: stdout, stderr, exit code, cwd, env and argv observed
 * rather than asserted about a mock. WP05.2's acceptance names the cases —
 * spaces, non-ASCII, a non-zero exit — so each is here as its own test with the
 * disk checked afterwards.
 *
 * The process half (what can be started at all, PATH, batch files, the
 * environment allowlist) is in `c09-process-evidence.test.ts`; the rig both files
 * share, and the measured reason each part of it exists, is in
 * `c09-harness.ts`.
