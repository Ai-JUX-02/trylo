/**
 * WP05.2, the process half: what can be started on this machine at all, and
 * under what environment.
 *
 * The data half (stdout, argv, cwd, non-zero exit, a pipeline) is in
 * `c09-pipes-evidence.test.ts`. This file is about the launch itself — the
 * program's name, the platform's own rules about startable files, and the
 * environment the child is handed — because those are the parts where "the
 * command ran" and "the command was safe to run" are different questions.
 */

/**
 * The batch case, stated separately because it is the one Windows shape that
 * cannot be started by `CreateProcess`: a `.cmd` is not an executable, so this
 * is the path `executable.ts` quotes its way through `cmd /s /c`.
 *
 * The assertion is about token BOUNDARIES, and the expectation comes from a
 * probe rather than from taste. Measured on this machine with the same
 * `cmd /d /s /c "<cmd> "<tok>" ..."` shape this spawner builds:
 *
 *     STAR=[%*]   with two tokens ->  ["hello"] ["world"]
 *     IDX =[%1]    with two tokens ->  ["hello"]["world"]
 *     IDX =[%1]    one token "a b"  ->  ["a b"][""]     (one argument, not two)
 *
 * So `%*` re-quoting each argument is cmd's own semantics, not a mangling of
 * ours — and `%~1` is the form that proves the boundary survived. The test
 * asserts the second, because "it printed something" is not the claim; "the
 * space did not become a separator" is.
