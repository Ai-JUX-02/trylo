/**
 * WP05.3: the boundary claims, each stated as something that would go red.
 *
 * WP05.3's acceptance has three parts that can be settled here, and one that
 * cannot:
 *
 *  - Authorization before launch. Settled below, by counting.
 *  - A refused command leaves nothing running. Settled below, by counting.
 *  - Isolation is not bypassed by a compatibility path. Settled below, by
 *    reading the type of the seam a caller has to go through.
 *  - A durable intent recorded before the side effect. NOT settled here: no such
 *    record exists in production. `grep -rn "intent" src/internal` finds only
 *    learning-domain `intentClass` and `intentOn`, and WP05's own text makes the
 *    durable part WP07's deliverable. Written down as OPEN-WP05-2 rather than
 *    faked with an in-memory counter that would prove nothing about durability.
 *
 * The counting seam is the point. "The error came back" and "nothing ran" are
 * different claims, and only the second one is the boundary.
