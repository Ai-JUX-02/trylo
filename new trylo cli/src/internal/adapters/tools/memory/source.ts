 * Where a memory read gets its records: the ones this run already owns.

 *
 *  - the learning board's **activated** assets — the same activation check the
 *    profile assembler performs, borrowed rather than reimplemented, so a memory
 *    hit can only ever name an asset the run would actually have been given.
 *    Reading a withdrawn or merely-proposed rule would put text in a model's
 *    context that the learning control plane has not agreed is true;
 *  - the project rule files the run adopted (`ProjectContext.sources`) — the
 *    same list that went into the seed messages, so a search result and the
 *    context the model already has cannot disagree about what the project said.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent: any write, any promotion, and any "this looks
 * important" judgement. Sedimentation and asset governance belong to the
 * learning control plane behind its own single writer. This module's entire
 * vocabulary is `read`.
 *
 * Both projections carry their provenance in `origin` and a real path in `path`,
 * so a hit a model quotes can be traced to the board asset or the rule file it
 * came from rather than floating free.
