/**
 * The five configuration layers and their precedence.
 *
 * This enumeration is owned by the settings package and is deliberately *not*
 * shared with `config/layers.ts` (the older four-layer loader). Coupling the two
 * would freeze the old loader's merge behaviour into this one, so the five-layer
 * model is free to name `system` explicitly while the old one has no slot for it.
 *
 * `config/layers.ts` is **no longer reachable from the CLI**: `surface/cli/config-load.ts`
 * drives this package through `adapters/settings-fs.ts`, and a boundary test pins
 * that no file under `surface/cli/**` imports the old loader. The old module is
 * kept only for non-CLI callers that have not migrated yet; it is not a second
 * load path for any command a user can run.
 *
 * Precedence, lowest to highest:
 *
 * ```text
 * packaged_default(0) -> system(10) -> user(20) -> project(30) -> cli_flag(40)
 * ```
 *
 * Environment variables are *not* a layer here, matching `config/layers.ts`:
 * they carry secrets and explicit overrides only, and secrets belong to the
 * credentials package, never to a settings file this loader will read.
 *
 * The numeric shape is copied from codex `ConfigLayerSource.precedence()`
 * (D6 §4.1): a sparse integer scale so a future layer can be inserted between
 * two existing ones without renumbering.
