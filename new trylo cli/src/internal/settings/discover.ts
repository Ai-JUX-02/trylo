/**
 * Where each file-backed layer lives, and which file wins inside one directory.
 *
 * Pure path logic plus an injected-existence probe; no filesystem calls of its
 * own, so the escape guard and the candidate ordering are testable without
 * touching a real home directory.
 *
 * Two ideas are copied from the survey (D6 §4.1 / §10.7):
 *
 *  - **Same-directory candidates, first existing wins** — opencode probes
 *    `["opencode.jsonc","opencode.json","config.json"]` in order and takes the
 *    first that exists. This package does *not* invent jsonc, so each layer's
 *    candidate list is currently length one (`config.json`); the ordered-probe
 *    mechanism is still here, and still tested, so adding a second candidate
 *    later is a one-line change with known semantics.
 *  - **Project must stay inside the workspace** — a project config is trusted
 *    because it lives in the tree the user opened. If the resolved candidate
 *    escapes that root, it is not a project config and is refused.

 profile root is overridable (`TRYLO_HOME`), spelling it that way splits the
 * profile: credentials and sessions follow the override and the config file does
 * not, so one `TRYLO_HOME` leaves a machine with two halves of a profile.
