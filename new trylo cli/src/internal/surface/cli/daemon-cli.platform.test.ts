/**
 * `trylo daemon start|status|stop` as a person actually runs it: a real child
 * process, a real binary, nothing injected.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The daemon's lifecycle was verified end-to-end — six processes racing one
 * lease, a spawn that survives its parent, a stop that works — and every one of
 * those probes either imported `daemon-main.js` itself or handed `createFileDaemon`
 * a launch config. None of them ran the command. Two defects lived through that:
 *
 *  1. the default launch target pointed two directories short, so `start`
 *     reported "spawned as pid N" for a child that died immediately; and
 *  2. the spawn never called `child.unref()`, so once the target was fixed and a
 *     real daemon stayed alive, **`trylo daemon start` never returned** — it hung
 *     holding the child handle until it was killed.
 *
 * Both are invisible from inside the adapter and obvious from the CLI, which is
 * the layer this test sits in.
 *
 * ## The one deadline
 *
 * `spawnSync` gets a timeout so a regression in direction (2) fails with an
 * error instead of hanging the gate forever. The deadline is generous (20s) and
 * only ever reached by broken code; a working `start` returns in well under a
 * second. Nothing here sleeps to make a passing case pass — the polling loop
 * below only waits for the daemon's own discovery record.
