/**
 * Manual reconciliation of effects whose outcome the run could not prove
 * (WP01.3).
 *
 * A tool call that crossed the execution boundary and then lost contact with
 * its result is neither failed nor succeeded — it is unknown, and the journal
 * refuses to resume until somebody says which it was. This is the command that
 * says it.
 *
 * Four rules are load-bearing and are why this file is shaped the way it is:
 *
 *  - **Listing writes nothing.** The default invocation is a read. A verdict
 *    requires `--turn`, `--key`, `--outcome` and `--evidence` together, and
 *    there is deliberately no flag that resolves everything at once: "clear the
 *    unknowns" is not a decision anybody can make about someone else's
 *    workspace.
 *  - **A verdict is addressed, not named.** A key alone recurs across turns, so
 *    a verdict carries the turn the issue happened in. Turn plus key is the
 *    address; if that is still ambiguous the verdict is refused rather than
 *    aimed at a guess.
 *  - **The verdict is recorded as a verdict.** It appends what the person
 *    determined and why. It never replays the action, never rewrites the
 *    original journal record, and never invents tool output: where no output
 *    exists, the record says so.
 *  - **Nothing here can unlock by force.** The closed set of outcomes is
 *    `committed` and `failed`. There is no "unknown" outcome to write (not
 *    deciding is the default) and no `--yes`, because a session's unknowns are
 *    exactly the set of things the machine could not find out.
