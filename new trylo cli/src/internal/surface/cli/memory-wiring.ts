/**
 * Where a run's memory tools read from (WP20.3: C60 / L51).
 *
 * Three facts decide whether this returns a port at all, checked in the order
 * that keeps the promise cheapest to keep:
 *
 *  - **no `--learning`, no board.** A run that never asked for learning never
 *    touches the board directory and gets no learning records. Same
 *    absent-means-off rule the rest of the wiring follows, and it matters more
 *    here than usual: a memory tool that answered "no matches" on a run with no
 *    memory would be indistinguishable from one that had forgotten everything;
 *  - **no board on disk, no learning records.** `--learning` is a switch, not a
 *    promise that anything was ever learned;
 *  - **the project context counts on its own.** Rule files the run adopted are
 *    memory too and exist whether or not learning is on, so a run with a project
 *    context gets `memory_search` over those records with the switch absent.
 *
 * The board is read **inside** the document source rather than here, so it is
 * read per search and not once per turn. That is what lets a rule activated
 * mid-turn be visible to the next search without a refresh mechanism, and it
 * keeps this function synchronous — a composition root that could block on a disk
 * read is a composition root that can hang a CLI.
 *
 * A board that exists but cannot be read is not this layer's failure to handle.
 * The board's own reader already owns the degraded-state policy; a second opinion
 * here would be a second policy. So learning records are dropped for that search
 * and the project records still answer.
