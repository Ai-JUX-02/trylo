 * Building the network tools' backends at the CLI composition root (WP20).

 * This file exists because both backends need facts only this layer has — which
 * provider was selected, what endpoint it declared, which credential resolved —
 * and because both answers are *conditional*:
 *
 *  - a **search backend** exists only for a provider family that actually offers
 *    hosted search. An OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint does not, so
 *    `createHostedSearchBackend` is not called for it and `web_search` is never
 *    mounted. That is the whole reason the search tool can be trusted to be
 *    absent rather than present-and-broken;
 *  - a **page extractor** exists only when there is a provider to ask. Without
 *    one, `web_fetch` does not offer `prompt` at all, which the plan refuses up
 *    front — so a model is never told it can ask a question the run cannot answer.
 *    The provider is threaded in from the composition root (`run-command.ts`),
 *    the same way `wiring.ts:296` builds the compaction summarizer from the
 *    provider it already holds;
 *
 * Neither backend is built speculatively. Construction is pure (no socket, no
 * file, no directory), and anything that would open one is behind the check that
 * would otherwise have made the tool unmountable.
