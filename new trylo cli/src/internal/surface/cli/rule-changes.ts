 * only honest thing to do is say so — silently adopting the new text would
 * leave a user comparing two runs unable to explain why the model started
 * ignoring a convention it followed yesterday, and silently keeping the old text
 * would have the run acting on rules the repository no longer contains.
 *
 * Compare by hash, not by prose: the point is to name *that a file changed*, and
 * reading two rule sets side by side to decide whether they differ would make
 * the diagnostic as expensive as the thing it reports.
 *
 * Nothing here writes. The old records stay exactly as they were written — a
 * journal that had been rewritten to match the present would stop being evidence
 * of anything (WP-CLI-B1 §6).
