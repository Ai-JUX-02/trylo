/**
 * `trylo daemon` handlers (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * Three verbs — `status`, `start`, `stop` — and they are enough because the daemon
 * has exactly one job: run the scheduler. `ps/logs/attach/kill` for background
 * *sessions* are a different noun with a different owner and are not faked here.
 *
 * ## What `start` is willing to claim, and when
 *
 * It reports "running" only after the daemon has written its own discovery record
 * carrying *this* pid, because a pid on its own is not a daemon: that wording used
 * to be "spawned as pid N — run `status` to find out", and it was a hedge that hid
 * a real defect (the default launch target pointed at a file that did not exist,
 * so every start "succeeded" and nothing ran). `adapter.start()` now waits for the
 * advertisement, so success here is a confirmed fact and a failure arrives with the
 * tail of the daemon's own log instead of a bare number.
 *
 * ## `stop` is honest about the grace period
 *
 * A graceful stop asks and returns; it does not wait for the process to die and
 * then claim it did. `--force` is a separate flag because "please stop" and "make
 * it stop" are different promises, and a flag is harder to pass by accident than a
 * mode argument somebody might default to.
