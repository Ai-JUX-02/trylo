 * list into a sentence, and doctor turns the same list into the same sentence.
 * Two renderings would be two answers, and the wrong one is invisible — a user
 * comparing `trylo doctor` against what the model was actually told would have
 * no way to tell which lied.
 *
 * Deliberately small: relative path, scope, and the short content hash. **Not**
 * the rule text. A diagnostic is something a user pastes into a bug report, and
 * a project's `AGENTS.md` can hold an internal host name, a release process, or
