/**
 * Which provider a run will use, and whose credential it will use.
 *
 * This file exists because the answer used to be one string. It is now four
 * facts — an id, a family, an endpoint and a model — and they have to be
 * decided together: a run that read the id from one source and the endpoint
 * from another would be the half-old/half-new provider D3 forbids.
 *
 * Precedence, highest first:
 *
 * ```text
 * --provider  ->  providers.json `selected`  ->  config `provider`  ->  fixture
 * ```
 *
 * `--endpoint` and `--model` still win over everything, because an override a
 * person typed on this command is the most specific thing this process knows.
 *
 * The zero-difference gate is the middle of that list. With no declared
 * providers the second source is absent, the third is whatever it always was
 * and the fourth is what every run got before any of this existed — so the
 * resolved object is the one the old path built, field for field.
