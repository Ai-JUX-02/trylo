/**
 * Config loading — the CLI's *only* load path.
 *
 * The engine is the five-layer settings package (`settings/**` driven by
 * `adapters/settings-fs.ts`): `discover` finds each layer's candidates, `parse`
 * validates them against the closed schema, `merge` applies `layerPrecedence`,
 * and `view` produces the public rendering. This file is a thin, CLI-shaped
 * adapter over that one call — it holds no second merge, no second default set
 * and no fallback to the older four-layer loader.
 *
 * Precedence, lowest to highest (sparse integer scale, copied from codex
 * `ConfigLayerSource::precedence`, D6 §4.1):
 *
 * ```text
 * packaged_default(0) -> system(10) -> user(20) -> project(30) -> cli_flag(40)
 * ```
 *
 * Environment variables are *not* a layer, and neither are credentials: a
 * credential resolves through `CredentialPort` (see `credentials-wiring.ts`),
 * which owns the declared environment table and the ledger files. A config file
 * may not even *carry* an `apiKey`: the closed schema refuses secret keys by
 * name, so the value never enters the resolved map to be redacted later.
 *
 * `cli_flag` is built from already-parsed argv (`run-settings.ts::flagLayer`),
 * never from the environment.
