 * commands used to print `1790376095491`-style ids next to
 * `2026-09-25T22:42:46.439Z` and `304023 bytes`, which is precise and unreadable:
 * every row was the same width of noise, so nothing stood out.
 *
 * Deliberately small and pure. `now` is passed in rather than read, because
 * "3 min ago" computed from a clock nobody injected is a test that cannot be
 * written and a value that cannot be pinned.
 *
 * Alignment here measures UTF-16 length, not terminal columns: everything these
 * commands format is ASCII (ids, times, byte counts). Anything that can carry
 * CJK or emoji belongs to `tui/frame.ts`, which has the real width table.
