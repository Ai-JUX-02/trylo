/**
 * The REPL's slash command table.
 *
 * One table, three jobs: what `/help` prints, which tokens are commands at all,
 * and — the part that matters — which inputs are *not* prompts. An unrecognised
 * slash token is reported as unknown and dropped; it is never forwarded to the
 * model as if it were something the user said. That is the whole reason the
 * table exists rather than a chain of `if` bodies: with a chain, a typo silently
 * becomes a prompt, and the only way to notice is to read the transcript.
 *
 * Table-driven, not reflection-driven: aider discovers `cmd_*` methods by
 * inspection, which is neat until a method you did not mean to expose becomes a
 * command. Here a command is a command because it appears in this array.
