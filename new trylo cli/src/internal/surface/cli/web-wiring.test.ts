 * config — an extractor, a clock, a fetch. That proves the parts work and says
 * nothing about whether a *run* ever supplies them, which is exactly the gap F2
 * and F3 live in: `prompt` was advertised and refused 100% of the time, and the
 * cache did not exist, while 60 tests stayed green. So these tests enter through
 * `wirePorts` / `webBackendsFor` — the two functions a real run passes through.
