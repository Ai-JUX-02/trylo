/**
 * Multi-line input: a trailing backslash joins the next line.
 *
 * A person pastes a prompt, or writes one long enough to wrap, and a REPL that
 * submits on every newline turns both into three half-sentences. The terminal
 * convention this build follows is backslash-then-Enter (Shift+Enter needs a
 * raw-mode keybinding this surface deliberately does not take).
 *
 * Two details that are easy to get wrong:
 * - `\\` at end of line is an escaped backslash, not a continuation — the
 *   person asked for a literal backslash at the end of their text.
 * - A continuation as the *last* thing read (EOF right after) still submits:
 *   the person pressed Enter, the backslash just gets dropped.
 *
 * Shared by both REPLs — a line that submits in one and continues in the other
 * would make the two surfaces disagree about what the person said.
