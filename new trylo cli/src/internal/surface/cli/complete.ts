/**
 * Completing a file path as it is typed.

 * editing their message, which is not what Tab is for.
 *
 * Directories come back with a trailing separator so one Tab can walk a whole
 * path — a candidate without it would make the next level unreachable without
 * typing the slash by hand.
 *
 * Pure: the directory listing is passed in, so this is testable without a
 * filesystem, and the composition root decides how directories are read.
