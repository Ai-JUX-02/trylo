/**
 * Where the secret for `trylo login` comes from.

 * Two sources, and one invariant: argv is never one of them.
 *
 * - A file is read under a hard size cap, because the whole file becomes the
 *   key and a mistyped path should not turn into a multi-megabyte secret.
 * - A terminal is read with echo off. The audit that produced this module found
 *   the opposite assumption in the code: a line reader built with
 *   `terminal: false` silences *itself*, while the terminal driver keeps
 *   printing every keystroke onto the screen. Raw mode is what silences the
 *   driver, and readline is not used here at all.
 *
 * Everything is injected — a file reader, a terminal, an error sink — so both
 * rules are testable without a pty and without a real profile directory.
