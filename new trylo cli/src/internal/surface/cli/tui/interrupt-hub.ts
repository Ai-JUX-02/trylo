/**
 * The interrupt hub: where the pure Ctrl-C machine meets the shell.
 *
 * Actions land as facts the loop reads at its next boundary — never a second
 * thread, never a mid-await kill. Two of them also reach the turn in flight,
 * because a flag checked at a boundary cannot stop a stream that is already
 * open: the hub holds the current turn's `AbortController` and the cancel path
 * aborts it. That is the whole of what the live wiring adds — the ordering
 * guarantees stay the loop's, not the shell's.
 *
 * The second interrupt is the one deliberate exception to "no mid-await kill":
 * what is in flight may be a read (a permission prompt, a line being typed) that
 * no abort can return from, so the process is left from here — what codex and
 * cline do for their own exit key. When the context carries no way to leave (a
 * test that injected line IO only), the flag alone is set and the loop's own
 * exit path returns the same code.
 *
 * It lives beside `entry.ts` rather than inside it so the entry keeps its line
 * budget, the same discipline the loop's size gates enforce.
