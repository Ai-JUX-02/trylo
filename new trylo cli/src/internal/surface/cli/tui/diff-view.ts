 * A unified diff inside tool output, rendered as the rows a person reads
 * (WP23.1 / L43).
 *
 * Tools that change files answer with unified diffs, and the line-level
 * heuristic (`toneOfDiffRow`) coloured the changes but dropped the one thing a
 * diff is for: where in the file each row sits. This renderer reads the hunk
 * headers, keeps its own old/new row counters, and puts the number in a gutter
 * the way every diff viewer does.
 *
 * It declines anything that is not a diff — one hunk header plus at least one
 * changed row is the minimum evidence — and the caller falls back to the
 * heuristic, so ordinary output that merely starts with `-` is untouched.
