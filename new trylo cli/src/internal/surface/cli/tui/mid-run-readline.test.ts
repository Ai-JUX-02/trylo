/**
 * The same reader, over a line source that behaves like a terminal.
 *
 * `mid-run-input.test.ts` drives the reader through a scripted line source: one
 * call, one line, in order. That model is convenient and it is *wrong* about the
 * one thing this package most needs to be right about. A real terminal line
 * source (`node:readline`, and the `ctx.readLine` in `cmd/trylo/main.ts` built on
 * it) has no cancel and no queue: two outstanding `question()` calls on one
 * interface mean the **first** one takes every line and the second never
 * resolves at all. A scripted source cannot show that — it has no notion of two
 * readers at once.
 *
 * So this file talks to a real `readline.Interface` over a stream, and walks the
 * shell's actual rhythm: a turn starts, the person types while it runs, the turn
 * ends, the prompt reads, the next turn starts. If the reader ever stops being
 * the shell's single reader, the prompt read below does not return a line — it
 * simply never answers, which is what a frozen shell looks like from inside.
 */

/**
 * A deadline, so a frozen reader is a failing assertion rather than a hang.
 *
 * The timer is deliberately *not* unref'd. A readline read on a plain stream
 * holds no libuv handle, so an unref'd deadline would let the event loop drain
 * and the runner would report "the event loop has already resolved" — which says
 * nothing about which behaviour failed. A ref'd timer keeps the loop alive long
 * enough for `LATE` to be the verdict.
