 * makes the rendering half testable without a terminal (work-package
 * contract #1).
 *
 * The status bar keeps its ANSI dimming; content lines are plain text so a
 * hard wrap can never cut an escape sequence in half.
 *
 * Wrapping and truncation measure **terminal columns**, not UTF-16 code units
 * (WP D4). Before that, `"中".repeat(50)` at width 80 was one 50-unit line that
 * a terminal then wrapped into two lines it had not been told about, and the
 * frame the shell believed it had drawn was not the frame on screen. The width
 * table below is written out rather than imported: this build adds no runtime
 * dependency, so it carries the ranges it needs and says which ones it carries.
