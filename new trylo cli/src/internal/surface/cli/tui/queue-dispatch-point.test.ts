/**
 * Where the idle dispatch point sits in the loop, and what it refuses to be.
 *
 * The queue itself is tested in `queued-dispatch.test.ts`. What is only visible
 * from inside the loop is **ordering** and **the two things a queued message is
 * not allowed to be**: not a slash command, and not something that jumps ahead
 * of a word the person just typed.
 *
 * Both matter more than they look. A slash command from a background message
 * would let a second terminal end this session; a queue that outranked the
 * prompt would answer a message that has been waiting a minute before the one
 * typed a second ago, which is the opposite of what "queued" is for.
