 * Contract #3, written the way `exec-substrate-discipline.test.ts` writes its
 * kind of contract: as a static scan, not as prose.
 *
 * The TUI is a surface over the one run host. It must never grow a second
 * loop, never call a provider or the tool port itself, never touch the
 * permission port, never build its own projection of envelopes, and — this
 * build's conservative line — never reach for `process` or raw-mode
 * switches. Scans run over stripped code so the bans themselves in comments
 * do not trip them.
