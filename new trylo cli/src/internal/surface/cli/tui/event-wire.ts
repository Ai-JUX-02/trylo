/**
 * The TUI's wire reader.
 *
 * The shell does not build a projection of its own — `tui/discipline.test.ts`
 * scans for exactly that. It runs the one run host with the `stream-json`
 * format and reads back the lines the host writes, so the shell is just
 * another consumer of the same event stream a parent process would read, and
 * `collectedSink` is where those lines become events again.
 *
 * The reader hands each event over the moment it is parsed rather than
 * collecting them for later (WP D1/D3): the shell advances its state and
 * repaints as the turn runs, instead of after it has finished.
