/**
 * The paste-burst machine (WP23.2 / C81, L39).
 *
 * A terminal that does not send bracketed paste delivers a paste as a burst of
 * ordinary characters, and a line editor that submits on Enter would fire the
 * first line of the paste as a command before the rest arrived. This machine
 * is the port of Codex's `bottom_pane/paste_burst.rs` semantics (source HEAD
 * `73a1148c9c775c2a4616ce5096291740a00ed68a`), reduced to what a burst needs:
 *
 * - the first character is held briefly (`RetainFirstChar`) so ordinary typing
 *   never sees a flicker;
 * - a second character inside the char interval begins a buffer and *retro*
 *   -grabs the held one;
 * - the buffer flushes as one paste once characters stop arriving;
 * - an Enter inside the suppress window after a flush is the paste's final
 *   newline, not a submit.
 *
 * Constants are Codex's: 3 chars minimum, 8 ms char interval (60 ms idle flush
 * on Windows — a Windows console coalesces reads differently), 120 ms Enter
 * suppression. Events carry the caller's timestamps: this module owns no
 * clock, so the machine stays testable without one.
