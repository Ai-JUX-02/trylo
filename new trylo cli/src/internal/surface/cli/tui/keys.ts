/**
 * Terminal input, decoded (WP23.2 / C81, L39).
 *
 * The prompt editor cannot sit on `node:readline`'s line mode: a readline
 * `question()` submits on every newline, which is exactly the paste disaster
 * this package exists to fix, and it offers no history search, no vim modes
 * and no paste events. So the composer reads *keys*, and this module is the
 * boundary between bytes and meaning: one chunk of terminal input in, the key
 * events it contains out.
 *
 * It is pure and stateful only across chunk boundaries — an escape sequence
 * split by the terminal between two reads is held until its tail arrives.
 * Bracketed paste (`ESC [ 200 ~ … ESC [ 201 ~`) is honoured first because it
 * is the one input a person cannot fake by typing fast; the burst machine in
 * `paste-burst.ts` covers terminals that do not send it.
