/**
 * The TUI's IO shell port.
 *
 * The renderer and the state are pure; this port is the only thing that
 * touches a terminal, and it is injected so the shell is testable without
 * one. The line adapter below is built entirely from the injected
 * `CliContext`: it adds no `process` access, no raw-mode switches and no
 * signal handlers, so this build's IO story stays exactly the one
 * `cmd/trylo/main.ts` already tells.
 *
 * `onInterrupt` is no longer dormant. The composition root builds the
 * `ctx.interrupts` capability in `cmd/trylo/main.ts` (the only file that may
 * touch `process`), and this adapter passes it straight through; the Ctrl-C
 * state machine in `entry.ts` then runs live. Absent — a context with no
 * interrupt source, which is every test that does not opt in — still means the
 * machine stays dormant rather than half-wired.
