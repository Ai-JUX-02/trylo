/**
 * The shell's reader, and the turn it feeds (WP08: C03, C82, L42).
 *
 * Two halves. The first is the reader on its own, driven by a line source this
 * test controls: what it takes, what it refuses, and what it hands back when the
 * turn stops asking. The second is the wiring — a turn that is handed a lender
 * actually reaches the loop with what the person said, and what it never
 * answered comes back out instead of disappearing.
 *
 * The line source is deliberately *not* a list of answers: a real terminal
 * blocks until a person presses Enter, and a fake that answers instantly would
 * model a machine typing faster than the turn can ask — which is how a first
 * draft of this feature made a turn of 1364 provider requests.
 *
 * It also counts outstanding reads, because that number is the defect this
 * design exists to prevent: with two reads outstanding on one terminal line
 * source the first one takes every line forever and the shell starves.
