/**
 * The TUI entry (work package T2).
 *
 * The dispatch contract: a bare `trylo` reaches this entry where `{ kind:
 * "repl" }` is handled today. When stdin is not a terminal this function IS
 * the old line REPL — the same `handleRepl` call, so the non-TTY behavior is
 * byte-identical by construction, not by reimplementation (contract #2, the
 * hard gate). On a terminal the TUI shell runs instead.
 *
 * The shell owns no loop of its own in the forbidden sense: every turn goes
 * through the one run host (`runOneTurn`), the slash table is the shared
 * one, and the only state it keeps is frame state fed by surface events.
 * What it deliberately does not do is call providers, touch permission
 * ports, or schedule tools — `tui/discipline.test.ts` scans for exactly
 * that.
 *
 * Turn events reach the shell through the `stream-json` wire contract: the
 * runner forces `format: "stream-json"` so the sink receives one JSON event
 * per line, and the collector parses them back into `CliStreamEvent`s. The
 * TUI is therefore just another consumer of the same event stream a parent
 * process would read — no second projection is built anywhere.
 *
 * Interrupts arrive through one capability bit (`ctx.interrupts`), built by the
 * composition root; the pure machine in `interrupt.ts` decides and this file
 * acts. The first Ctrl-C cancels the turn in flight — a state transition inside
 * the loop, ending `cancelled` — and the second leaves the process with 130,
 * the cancellation exit code the table already had.
