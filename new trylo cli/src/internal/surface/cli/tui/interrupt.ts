/**
 * The Ctrl-C state machine (work-package contract #4).
 *
 * Semantics, aligned with codex's cancellation behavior: the first interrupt
 * cancels the *current thing* — the running turn, or the input line being
 * typed — and the process stays alive; a second consecutive interrupt exits.
 * Any other key between two interrupts resets the count, so a stray Ctrl-C
 * an hour ago never makes the next one lethal.
 *
 * This module is a pure reducer. The IO shell feeds it interrupts and acts on
 * the action it returns. In this build the line adapter cannot observe
 * interrupts at all (only the composition root may touch `process`), so the
 * machine ships fully tested and dormant until the interrupt source is wired
 * — see OPEN-T2-2 in `T2-HANDOFF-MANIFEST.md`.
