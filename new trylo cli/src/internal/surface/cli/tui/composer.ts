/**
 * The prompt composer (WP23.2 / C81, L39, L40).
 *
 * The raw key source feeds it; it owns the one echo of what the person is
 * typing, and routes keys to the machines that do the work: the buffer
 * (`composer-buffer.ts`) for text and pastes, history (`composer-history.ts`)
 * for the walk and the Ctrl-R search, the binding table (`keybindings.ts`)
 * for everything a person may rebind. What it does *not* own is where lines
 * go after Enter — at the prompt the caller resolves the composed text,
 * mid-run the input queue stages it (`mid-run-input.ts`), and a foreign
 * reader (the approval panel, a menu, the echo-off secret reader) is wrapped
 * by `borrowTerminal`, which suspends this composer so two readers never hold
 * the same stream.
 *
 * Paste protection has two layers and trusts them in this order: a bracketed
 * paste the terminal announced is a paste, full stop; everything else runs
 * through the burst machine (`paste-burst.ts`), whose semantics are ported
 * from Codex. A paste arrives as one string with its newlines inside — one
 * submission, never one command per line.
 *
 * Ctrl-C is not decided here: the key is routed to the shell's interrupt
 * machine (`interrupt.ts`), which already owns the once-cancels, twice-exits
 * contract; this module only carries out the "clear the line" action it is
 * told about.
