/**
 * The turn's live region (WP D3).
 *
 * Until this existed the shell collected every event and wrote the new lines
 * once, after the turn had ended, so a long answer appeared all at once. The
 * region is now redrawn as events arrive: the cursor moves back over the lines
 * this turn has already drawn (`\x1b[{n}A`), everything from there down is
 * cleared (`\x1b[J`), and the content is written again with the status bar
 * under it.
 *
 * Two properties are what make that safe. Nothing is dropped — a deferred
 * repaint draws the *latest* state, and `settle` draws once more whatever is
 * still pending, so the final paint always holds the whole turn. And the line
 * count is remembered exactly: the next paint moves up by the number of lines
 * the previous one wrote, not by the number it meant to write.
 *
 * Nothing here runs outside a terminal. The shell is only entered when stdin
 * is a TTY (`handleReplEntry`); a piped `trylo` is the line REPL itself, which
 * emits no cursor movement at all (WP D3, criterion A6).
