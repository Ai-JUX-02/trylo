 * writes to a terminal. The frame renderer (`frame.ts`) is a second pure
 * function over this state, so the whole rendering half of the TUI is
 * testable without any IO — which is the shape the work package asks for
 * (contract #1: same input, same output).
 *
 * The state is fed by the existing surface event stream (`CliStreamEvent`)
 * and by nothing else. The status bar may show session facts and the tool
 * calls the events themselves opened and closed; it never predicts what the
 * loop is doing (contract #5: read the events, do not guess).
