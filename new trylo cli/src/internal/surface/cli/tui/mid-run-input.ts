/**
 * The shell's one line reader, which can also feed a running turn (WP08: C03,
 * C82, L42).
 *
 * Before this existed the shell's only reader sat in the prompt loop: it read a
 * line, handed it to a turn, and waited for that turn to finish before reading
 * again — so everything typed while a turn was running sat in the terminal's
 * own buffer and was delivered, all at once, as the *next* prompt. A person watching
 * a run go the wrong way had no way to say so.
 *
 * **Why this is one long-lived reader and not a second one that starts and
 * stops with a turn.** A first draft did exactly that, and it froze the shell:
 * the reader kept one `readLine` outstanding while the turn ran, and that read
 * could not be taken back when the turn ended. A probe of `node:readline` says
 * what happens then — with two `question()` calls outstanding on one interface,
 * the **first** waiter receives the line and the second never receives anything,
 * ever (`probe-readline2.cjs`: `pump: ["typed-at-the-prompt"] shell: []`,
 * `prompt settled: false` after a second line). The prompt would have starved
 * permanently after the very first turn. A terminal line source has no cancel,
 * so the only sound shape is one reader for the life of the shell: it owns every
 * read, and routes each line by whether a turn is in flight.
 *
 * Three facts make it safe to run beside a turn:
 *
 *  - **A line is taken once.** `drainInbox` empties what it hands over, so a
 *    second asking finds nothing rather than delivering the same words twice.
 *  - **Refusal has a reason.** A queue at its ceiling, a blank line, words typed
 *    after the turn closed — each is reported, because words dropped without a
 *    reason are words the person types again into a turn that cannot hear them
 *    either.
 *  - **Ending a turn is not discarding.** `end` hands back what was never taken,
 *    so a turn that ended with words still in its inbox gives them to the shell
 *    instead of garbage-collecting them.
 *
 * The turn's identity is *not* known when a line is typed — the run host mints
 * it — so typed lines are staged until the loop first asks, and the inbox is
 * opened in the name of the turn that asked. Staging is bounded by the same
 * ceiling as the inbox, so a person who keeps typing meets the same refusal a
 * queue would give them instead of an unbounded list.
 *
 * **Where the lines come from (WP23.2).** With a composer, the pump reads the
 * composer instead of `readLine`: at the prompt the composer draws and edits
 * (paste protection, history, history search), mid-run it captures drafts and
 * hands each line to `stage` through `beginCapture`. Without one — every test
 * that injects line IO, every non-terminal — the old `readLine` pump runs, byte
 * for byte as it was.
 *
 * Not solved here, and deliberately left to the composer itself: the drawing of
 * the line being typed. The composer owns prompt echo and exposes the mid-run
 * draft for the painter; this module only stages and delivers submitted words.
