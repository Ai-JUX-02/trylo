 * Split out of `entry.ts` because the entry is the shell's shape — startup, the
 * prompt loop, the slash table — and this is the one thing that happens inside
 * an iteration of it: hand the text to the run host, keep the frame current
 * while it runs, and say what became of every word the person said.
 *
 * What it owns and the entry does not: the painter for this turn, and the cancel
 * controller the interrupt hub reaches for. Both are per-turn objects, and both
 * are closed before this function returns.
 *
 * The reader is *not* per-turn, and that is the whole trick: a terminal line
 * source has no cancel, so a reader that started and stopped with each turn
 * would leave a read parked that the next prompt can never be served from. The
 * entry owns one reader for the session and lends it here for the duration of a
 * turn.
 *
 * The one promise it makes about words: none are dropped. What the turn took is
 * delivered; what it was handed and never delivered comes back out as
 * `leftover` for the prompt to run.
