/**
 * The tone-to-escape-sequence table: the one place that knows what colour a
 * kind of line is.
 *
 * Every mature terminal UI this build was measured against keeps this as an
 * indirection rather than scattering `\x1b[` literals through the renderer —
 * codex has `StatusTone`, gemini-cli has `semantic-tokens`, opencode has a
 * `Theme` type with an ANSI fallback, goose has `accent()/success()/danger()`.
 * The reason is always the same: the renderer says *what* a line means, and
 * this table decides *how* it looks, so a terminal that cannot do colour gets
 * a different answer without the renderer knowing.
 *
 * The palette is deliberately the 16-colour ANSI set, not truecolor. A CLI
 * runs on whatever terminal the person already has, including ones that
 * report eight colours, and 16 is the most that survives that. Bright variants
 * are avoided for the same reason: on several terminals "bright" is really
 * "bold", which would make every tool line shout.
 *
 * Nothing here emits a sequence on its own. A style is a value; `paint` is the
 * only function that puts one around text, so a caller that never paints gets
 * byte-identical output to a build without this file at all.
