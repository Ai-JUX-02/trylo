 * what a wait means: how a call is recognised as a question or a plan, what
 * the wait names, and the visible panel a person reads. Everything here is a
 * pure function of the tool call and its result — the same input always
 * produces the same wait and the same rows, so a panel can be tested without
 * a terminal and the status bar cannot disagree with it.

 * what the loop might be doing. The question and the plan survive the turn
 * that asked for them (an async question outlives its turn by design), and
 * each names what the person can do about it: answer, approve, or cancel.
