/**
 * The status bar: one deterministic line over the frame state, fitted to the
 * width it has.
 *
 * Everything it shows is either a session fact (session id, provider, model,
 * iteration ceiling), something a surface event said (the running flag, the
 * last `run_result`'s iteration count, status, token counts and duration), or
 * a tool call opened and not yet closed. Nothing is extrapolated: while a turn
 * runs without a new event, the bar keeps the last known facts.
 *
 * The fit is a priority order, not a truncation. Until this changed the bar was
 * assembled left to right and then cut, which meant the only thing a narrow
 * terminal was guaranteed to keep was the session id — the least useful field
 * on it — while the iteration budget and the token count were silently amputated
 * at the right-hand end. Now every field declares how much it matters, and the
 * ones that do not fit are the ones that do not fit *by choice*: `phase` and
 * the current model take priority over iteration and token diagnostics.
