/**
 * WP-CLI-B1 §9: a resumed run must be able to say which project rules changed.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is specific and quiet. A user edits
 * `AGENTS.md` on Monday, resumes on Tuesday, and the model stops following a
 * convention it followed last week. Nothing errors. Nothing is logged unless this
 * code says so, and the user's only explanation would be that the tool lost the
 * rules — when in fact the tool read the new ones, correctly.
 *
 * So the change has to be *visible*, and visible without rewriting history: the
 * journal keeps what was true then, and the run reports what is true now.
