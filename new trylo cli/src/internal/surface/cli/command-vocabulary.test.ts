 * The vocabulary must match what the router and the completion scripts actually

 *
 * ## What each case catches
 *
 * The family table is keyed by `FamilyWord`, so a word with no runner is a
 * compile error and needs no test. What *can* drift silently is the other
 * direction: `args.ts` claiming a verb this list forgot, or a shell script
 * carrying its own copy of the list. Both happened — `TOP_LEVEL` in
 * `completion.ts` was missing `checkpoint`, `queue`, `diff`, `review`,
 * `providers`, `schedule` and `daemon` while all seven parsed and ran fine.
 * A verb that works but never completes is a verb nobody finds.
