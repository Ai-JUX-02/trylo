/**
 * The CLI's one binding to the credential ledger.
 *
 * Everything that knows *how* a credential is resolved — which environment
 * variables count, which files hold which scope — lives behind `CredentialPort`.
 * This module only decides what the composition root hands the port (the
 * profile root, the current workspace as the project scope, an injected
 * environment snapshot) and what a port failure means for the process exit
 * code. No other
 * CLI file may read a declared credential variable, which is what retires the
 * old `TRYLO_API_KEY` side-reads in the config loader and the doctor.
 *
 * Two bindings live here, not one. `createCliCredentialPort` is the documented
 * default and is unchanged: the file ledger, and nothing else. Its companion
 * `createCliCredentialPortWithReport` adds the *opt-in* selection of an OS
 * keyring in front of it (WP `2026-09-16-WP-传统CLI-交付面收尾波` D4/D5) — off
 * unless `TRYLO_PREFER_KEYRING` is exactly `"1"`, and reported through an
 * injected warning channel when the keyring turns out to be unavailable, so the
 * ledger binding keeps its `CredentialPort`/`Result` shape rather than growing a
 * second one.
