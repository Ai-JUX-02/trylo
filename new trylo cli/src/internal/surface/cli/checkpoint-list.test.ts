/**
 * C2: an empty checkpoint store is an answer, not a failure.
 *
 * Before this, `trylo checkpoint list` on a machine that had never snapshotted
 * anything printed a raw `ENOENT` and left with 75 — the code that means
 * "temporary, try again" — while `trylo session list`, asked the same kind of
 * question, said "no sessions". The difference was never a decision.
 *
 * The second case here is the one that keeps the fix honest: a root that exists
 * but cannot be read must stay a failure. A blanket "any list error is empty"
 * would have made the first case pass and quietly swallowed real storage faults.
