 * itself never enters any output, in either format.
 *
 * The third rule is the one the account binding added. When a declaration names
 * an account, the row is about *that* account, not about whichever one the
 * family's current pointer happens to name, because "logged in" must not be able
 * to mean "logged in somewhere else". That is why the resolver used here is
 * `getAccount`, not `get`: `get` follows the pointer, and following it would
 * turn a binding into a suggestion.
