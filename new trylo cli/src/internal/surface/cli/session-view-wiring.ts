 * both registries are still built exactly once per wiring, so the tools that
 * observe a command and the processes they observe stay the same objects. A
 * registry constructed inside the catalog would be a second one, holding
 * sessions nothing else could reach — the catalog would advertise session
 * tools and every one of them would answer "no such session" forever.
