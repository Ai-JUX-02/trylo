/**
 * `trylo daemon start` must launch something that exists.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The daemon's whole lifecycle was verified end-to-end — six processes racing for
 * one lease, a real spawn, a stop that works — through a probe that imported
 * `daemon-main.js` directly, and through `daemonLaunchFor()`, the injectable hook
 * for tests. Neither of those ever read the *default* launch path the person
 * typing `trylo daemon start` actually gets. So `daemon start` reported "spawned
 * as pid 58536" while pointing `node` at a file that did not exist, and only
 * `daemon status` — honest, saying "stopped" — revealed it.
 *
 * That is the same shape this package has now hit three times: green harness,
 * broken binary. The fix is not more care, it is a test that reads the default.
