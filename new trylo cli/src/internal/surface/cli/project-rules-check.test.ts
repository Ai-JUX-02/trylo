/**
 * WP-CLI-B1 §3.3: a diagnostic a user can check the run against.
 *
 * Two claims are under test, and they are different ones.
 *
 * The first is that the line says the useful thing — which file, which subtree,
 * which version — while staying small enough to paste into a bug report. The
 * size half is not a style preference: a project's `AGENTS.md` routinely names
 * internal hosts and release procedures, and a diagnostic that printed it would
 * be copying the project's secrets into terminal scrollback on every `doctor`.
 *
 * The second is the one §3.3 actually forbids: doctor and run must not each
 * resolve rules their own way. That is asserted against the real filesystem
 * through the real `runDoctor`, because a test that passed hand-built source
 * lists to both sides would be asserting that a function is deterministic, which
 * was never in doubt.
