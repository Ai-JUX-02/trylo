/**
 * The CLI's one binding to the MCP server registry.
 *
 * Everything that knows how a registry file is locked, read and replaced lives
 * behind `McpRegistryPort`. This module decides only two things: where the two
 * files are, and what a port failure means for the process exit code. It is the
 * management-plane counterpart of `credentials-wiring.ts`, and it exists so no
 * command handler has to name a path.
 *
 * Scopes follow the same roots the rest of the profile uses — `tryloHome()` for
 * the user file, the workspace for the project file — so a registry can never
 * end up on a different volume than the sessions and credentials it sits next
 * to. `tryloHome` is reused rather than restated: there is one definition of
 * where the profile lives.

 *    user can fix it by typing something else.
 *  - **`CONFIG`** — a file on disk is not a registry this build can read. That
 *    is not the caller's fault and not an execution failure; it is the same
 *    class as an unreadable `config.json`.
 *  - **`EXECUTION_FAILURE` / `TEMPORARY`** — the file could not be reached or
 *    written. A `lock_conflict` is the one code an outer caller may retry, so
 *    it is the one that gets the retryable exit code.
 *
 * The `Record` type makes adding a code to the port a compile error here rather
 * than a silently mis-filed exit code.
