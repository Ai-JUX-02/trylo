/**
 * The one person-facing escalation, and the owner of the tickets it issues
 * (C65).
 *
 * Two properties are the whole design:
 *
 *  - There is no "remember" answer. Every other prompt in this CLI can be told
 *    to remember, because repeating a call is harmless; here the thing being
 *    released is a boundary, and a remembered boundary release is just a
 *    disabled sandbox. The prompt therefore offers yes/no/cancel and nothing
 *    else.
 *  - The ticket is a reference. What was released, for which call, with which
 *    arguments is kept here and read back through `redeem`, which spends it in
 *    the same call. A caller that invents a ticket id gets nothing, because
 *    nothing here was ever written under it.
