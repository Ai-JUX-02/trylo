/**
 * The scheduler daemon's process entry point (WP26 / A04).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, given `main.ts` is "the only file allowed to touch
 * process"
 *
 * `main.ts` builds a `CliContext` for a **human-facing command** and exits. A
 * daemon is the opposite: no terminal, no prompt, and its whole job is to not
 * exit. Folding it in would mean either a second context shape in the file that
 * owns the first one, or a run loop inside a dispatcher whose every other branch
 * returns.
 *
 * So this is a second entry point, and it borrows the discipline that makes
 * `main.ts`'s exemption necessary in the first place: **the environment is read
 * once, through a named seam** (`process-ambient.ts`), and this file makes no
 * decisions of its own. Every decision — when to fire, what firing means, what to
 * do with the lease — lives in `createSchedulerLoop`. If this file grew a policy,
 * it would be the second place that policy exists.
 *
 * ## Why it prints nothing
 *
 * The daemon is spawned with `stdio: "ignore"` (see `file-daemon.ts` for why), so
 * anything written to stdout would either be lost or would reopen the terminal pipe
 * that was deliberately closed. Diagnostics go to a file under the same home: a
 * daemon nobody can ask what it is doing is a daemon nobody can debug — but a file,
 * not a stream.
