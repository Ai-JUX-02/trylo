"""User-takeover primitives and takeover state machine (spec §11.3 / DoD-7).

The takeover protocol answers one question with hard evidence: WHO is
driving the desktop right now — the agent, or the user?

Three primitives, all injectable for deterministic tests:

``injection_tag()`` / ``tag_matches()``
    Every Trylo-injected input event carries this value in its Win32
    ``dwExtraInfo`` field. A low-level hook (or any future reader of
    ``GetMessageExtraInfo``) can therefore tell Trylo's own synthetic input
    apart from real user input — the spec's「不把自身输入当用户抢占」
    requirement. The tag encodes a fixed TRYLO magic word in the high 16
    bits and a random per-session value in the low 16 bits: matching on the
    high word is stable, the low bits keep sessions distinguishable.

``TakeoverDetector``
    ``GetLastInputInfo``-backed user-input detector. Real user input
    (keyboard, mouse, HID) bumps the OS last-input tick; so does Trylo's own
    SendInput, which is why the guard snapshots a pre-dispatch tick and
    filters its OWN injections with a compensation margin instead of
    treating every tick change as a user event.

``TryloTakeoverGuard``
    The §11.3 state machine, one instance per Desktop actor service:

    .. code-block:: text

        IDLE
        → AGENT_PREPARING        (guard_enter_dispatch before resolve/plan)
        → AGENT_DISPATCHING      (guard_arm_dispatch right before injection)
        → VERIFYING              (guard_enter_verification, read-only)
        → IDLE                   (guard_exit — no takeover, effect verified)

    A non-Trylo user input during a phase transitions:

    - ``AGENT_PREPARING``  → ``CANCELLED``      (nothing was sent)
    - ``AGENT_DISPATCHING`` → ``SAFE_RELEASE``  (caller releases held
      buttons/keys via ``safe_release_input``) → ``YIELDED``
    - ``VERIFYING``        → stays ``VERIFYING`` but ``mutating=False``:
      read-only verification may finish; further mutations are refused
      until ``guard_reset`` opens the NEXT explicit dispatch window.

    The machine is synchronous and pure with respect to its injected
    detector; the Desktop actor calls it inline. It never waits, sleeps, or
    dispatches anything itself.
