"""Low-level user-input hook for EXACT takeover detection (spec §11.3).

``TakeoverDetector``'s ``GetLastInputInfo`` tick is a heuristic: Trylo's own
SendInput bumps the same tick, so the guard needs a compensation margin that
both delays real-takeover detection mid-dispatch and can misclassify a fast
user event landing inside the margin. This module removes the guesswork: a
WH_KEYBOARD_LL / WH_MOUSE_LL hook sees EVERY input event with its
``dwExtraInfo`` marker, and Trylo-injected events carry the §11.3 tag (set
in ``uia.core`` on every SendInput) — so a non-Trylo event is a real user
input, by hard evidence, at the event's own timestamp.

Design (mirrors ``broker/winevent.py``, the proven hook-thread template):

- a dedicated daemon thread installs both LL hooks and pumps messages
  (WH_*_LL callbacks arrive on the installing thread's queue; without a
  pump the OS silently drops the hooks after ``LowLevelHooksTimeout``);
- the callback extracts primitives only — message id and ``dwExtraInfo`` —
  and records the latest non-Trylo event under a lock. No dispatching, no
  state-machine writes: the takeover state machine stays pure (P2-04
  audit), the guard CONSUMES the recorded timestamps through
  ``TakeoverDetector``;
- every failure path degrades to the existing tick heuristic: installation
  failure, a dead pump, an unloadable user32 — all leave the watcher
  reporting unavailable and the guard falling back, never fail-closed.

Liveness contract: a hook that stops delivering (starved pump, OS-dropped
hook) must never read as "no user input". The pump publishes a heartbeat
from the hook thread itself; ``pump_alive()`` gates the precise verdict, and
a stale heartbeat downgrades consumers to the tick heuristic.
